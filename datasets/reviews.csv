Especially when I find that they have Ugali, which is very similar to sadza or mieliepap, that I know from Sub-Saharan Africa.

The waiter that served me could speak English, which saved me from subjecting him to my broken Arabic, and was helpful at pointing out which dishes were vegetable only, and also highlighting which had no ghee (I'm vegan).

I ordered the Ugali with beans and salad. It was delicious comfort food.

I couldn't give them 5, only because he also brought out king fish curry on the tray, which I couldn't eat as a vegan. I recognise he only did this, because he was proud of it, and I wasn't billed for it, so I'm hovering between a 4 and a 5, because the rest of the meal was delicious and exactly what I wanted and needed. In the end, I think of the other restaurants I rated a 5, which were truly exceptional, so I think this one earns a well-deserved 4, for what it is ... A cheap, friendly restaurant and takeaway, with good, comfort food from Africa, Zanzibar and the Gulf.",Solo travel,2022-12-31

680032227,23718263,2050,1,2019-06-08T17:32:50Z,Low quality in 5 stars hotel," Food less than expectations ..
Some employees are the worst i ever seen in my life like Jeoy .. who is not able to speak politly or even do the minimum requirement ... we requested a small thing .. after he refused i told him that i will checkout because of this silly attitude... he surprised me by telling "" its up to you its not my issue"" the most rude answer i heared from a hotel employee ... some waiters also can't smile in front of us ... 

Some employees trying to recover this horiple restorant like shef Kareem ..  he made some good dishes after we asked him and represented them with his great smile .and Umakanta was polite and welcoming person.

Over all this restorant is in a mess and i couldn't understand their standards of low hospitality and low quality of food compared with any restorant.

Me and My wife are very annoyed because of bad behavior of most of the employees who do not have enough experience and knowledge to work in 5 stars hotel .. if we can call it 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!

Just as we arrived, I started to feel very ill from a medical condition that I have.  Once we were seated, my situation deteriorated quickly and I had to quickly leave.  I simply have to say that the owners somehow spotted my distress and their kindness showed no bounds.  They stood outside with me, comforted me, brought beverages‚Ä¶..anything I needed, then secured us a cab and discretely got us back to our hotel (we live out of town).  We ended up extending our stay when my symptoms disappeared the following day and we returned to Al‚Äôs the next evening.  We couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed the entire evening and experience more!  We devoured our calamari and then, of course, our spectacular steaks.  Our server, Brandy, couldn‚Äôt have been more gracious and friendly.

My visit to ""Al Baik"" in Madinah was far from what I expected. The order process at the cashier was chaotic and noisy, making it difficult to communicate. I ordered two Shrimp Sandwiches without being informed of the additional wait time they required. The process of collecting the order was disorganized, with customers pushing aggressively to give their receipts to the staff. I experienced a significant delay with my order, ticket number 190 from 20.12.2023, while orders like number 211 were served before me. The workers' shouting and machine noise made the 20-minute wait, which is lengthy for fast food, even more challenging. Meanwhile, the taxi I had waiting added to the urgency, as the taximeter was running.

The quality and size of the Shrimp Sandwich were even more disappointing. The sandwich was tiny, barely 1.5 bites, and for the price of 21 SAR (about 5 euros), I expected more, especially considering that in Switzerland, I could get a larger, better sandwich from a cleaner store for the same amount.

The menu is quite varied with something for every taste, but we (wisely!) decided to sample from the Omani cuisine page (see my note below about menu layout) and were not disappointed!

If you prefer other international cuisines, they serve those as well.  The restaurant sits with panoramic windows to the sea so you can enjoy beautiful views of the Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. 

A previous reviewer erroneously criticized the menu layout as being backwards. Oman is of course an Arab country and Arabic is read right to left, with books, menus being oriented opposite as well to western language publications. The menu is in both Arabic and English though the rightly layout follows that of the native language.

Both nonexistent.

We ordered Indian food and given that Indian food is common here and kitchen cooks are Indian, you'd imagine it'd be good.

Secondly, on a Friday at 2 pm, there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. Serving at least 5 tables and 20 people.

462868433,8129972,1958,3,2017-02-26T05:30:09Z,"Decent food, and the only place in the area to have a drink","The Darts Bar is located in the lower level of the Atana Khasab hotel, next to the main restaurant (both the bar and the restaurant have the same food and drinks menu).  The bar itself is, well, a simple bar.  There are darts, and a large tv showing sports highlights.
It may not be fancy but it is comfortable, and quiet enough that you can have a conversation with your friends without having to raise your voice.

Darts Bar has a full service bar and a full service food menu, which appears to be similar if not the same as the food menu at the other Atana hotel, the Atana Musandam.  The service is very friendly and attentive.  I really liked the bartender that worked the nights I visited.

The bar has a full range of drinks-  spirits, wine, and beer, though the choices of beer and wine are not long (don't expect any craft beers here:  think Budweiser, Heineken, Amstel Light, etc.).  In general, the cocktails are the most affordable, the beer prices are in the middle, and the wine is the most expensive.  But, considering that this is the only game in town (and for miles and miles beyond that), prices are not that bad.  Honestly, you will probably pay more for a beer at a concert or sports event in your home town.

The food is reasonably priced, given the limited choices in the area.  The menu tries to appeal to everyone, so there is a mix of European/American, Middle Eastern, Indian, and local Omani dishes.  The Omani dishes are sort of a mix of Moroccan, Middle-Eastern, and Indian ingredients and flavors.  There are plenty of options for vegetarians.  My only disappointment with the food options was a lack of fish choices.  Given how important fishing is to the local economy, I expected to see more fish dishes on the menu.

If you are spending a night or two in Khasab, and you are looking for a nice meal (and a drink), I recommend going to the Darts Bar.",Friends getaway,2017-02-28

We were amateurs on the first night and asked if this place took credit cards (found out on second day that Khasab is mostly a cash only economy).

Our hosts did not want payment to be an obstacle and said we can just come in as guests. We of course paid because they accepted UAE Dirhams (which we had because of the stay there).

Tasty Tabouleh salad, lots of freshly made bread (Naan), and sumptous mixed grill. 

I have noticed this in two restaurants: the variety and how they grill is some of the best I have experienced. Its as if Khasab is the center of the world's meat industry.  The amount, variety, and how its cooked is unparalleled and the price point, I just don't understand since most of this stuff is important.

Well, you can't eat in the Hilton Hotel every night for three weeks, and the Khareef is but a five minute drive away!  Parking outside if you have you have your own car, or just a brief taxi ride away.

Extensive choice of food, always very well prepared, great service, huge portions (as my friend said in his concurrent review, share the rice), and typical Salalah outstanding value for money.

Almost every breakfast menu item offers eggs of some kind. I don‚Äôt have previously been allergic to eggs but the board outside advertised freshly baked croissants and crepes. When we arrived we had to wait 5 minutes until any staff appeared. When they did,  I found out that the black coffee option was a filter drip with ‚Äòpowder‚Äô ( maybe Nescaf√©? ) and there were no pods for the Nespresso machine. So I asked if they could make Turkish coffee - yes she consented so we ordered. Then to the menu. Apart from pancakes every hot meal had eggs, and the continental breakfast was expensive and limited. I had trouble deciding and finally ordered. 5 minutes later I decided I‚Äôd made a mistake and asked to change to the continental b‚Äôfast but the waitress refused to switch my order. She told me the ordering system was sensitive and she would lose her job if she canceled an order. My choice she said was to order, and pay for, a second dish.

The starters we all had ( mussels and prawn and chorizo) were delicious. Two of us ordered Fillet surf and turf. I ordered rib eye with blue cheese sauce. Our other family member ordered t-bone with pepper sauce. The two fillets and the ribeye were so delicious. Unfortunately the T-bone was full of gristle on one half and they left it. He did say half of the T-bone(fillet side) was lovely. We did say to the waiter who cleared our plates that maybe mention to the chef to check the next order on a t-bone to double check it.

Disappointingly we have noticed over the last couple of visits the quality (& quantity) of the products has got less & less.

The pork belly for a starter was always my favourite until the time we went and the portion was literally half what it used to be.

Last night, as always, I ordered the green asparagus as a side. Previously you would get the big thick crunchy asparagus which was absolutely delicious. Last night I received the skinny ones you can buy in Lulu for .900 fils! What a rip off when they are charging 2.7 BD for them.

When the bill came we were told the steaks were ‚Äòfrom the grill‚Äô section of the menu and the entertainer voucher was for a main course! What a load of tripe. Is a steak a starter? Is it a dessert? No it‚Äôs a main meal yet now they have decided not to honour the entertainer for items ‚Äòfrom the grill‚Äô - absurd! Our steaks aren‚Äôt even grilled so that in itself is laughable. There are items in the main course section the same price as steaks so honestly what difference does it make.

Waiter was miserable & never broke a smile once, ambience was non existent. The maitre d did try to offer us a 15% discount which we declined. As an IHG ambassador I don‚Äôt need your discount nor the points - using the entertainer has always just been a bonus for one of our favourite restaurants.

We are die-hard brunch aficionados, frequently planning our travel itineraries to accommodate luxury, free-flow brunches. In theory, this should have been a very good experience; a beautiful venue, nicely set-up buffets and a friendly welcome. In practice, however, there were unfortunately a number of irritants:

- a massive amount of people had been crammed into one space. A number of the tables around us appeared to be children (in their hundreds, it felt) celebrating birthdays. Parents were present but seemed more preoccupied with the cocktails. A free-flow brunch usually evolves or disintegrates (depending on your view) at some point in the afternoon to a very lively affair. In this case, though, it was all a bit too much and way too crowded, loud and busy.

- drinks service was very slow. Our waiter was friendly and obviously did his best, but he only had two hands. Our glasses often went empty. It became a game of ‚Äúspot the waiter, try and grab his attention and hope he remembers to bring you something at some point.‚Äù

- no champagne, only sparkling wine.

- the only cocktail station available served only a couple, anything but innovative, drinks. I asked for a fruity cocktail with vodka (vodka and gin were the two choices available). I was told they could only do a mix with pineapple and orange juice. Boring. At the same time, waiters did serve other cocktails as well, but you had to know to ask for them. In consequence, one table ordered mojitos, and this gradually spread so that everyone in the entire restaurant was ordering mojitos. Then one table ordered another drink, and everyone started ordering that drink.

Overall, the food was good but a Friday brunch is about so much more than just the food.",Couples,2019-04-30

Not only was the staff, environment, and ambience outstanding, but the food itself succeeds in quality and taste. As we were seated, the staff was incredibly helpful and kindhearted while taking our orders and serving our food. Seats were comfortable, tables were spaces nicely, but most importantly the overall restaurant was beautiful. We tried a variety of things from the menu, and they did not disappoint at all.

Easily accessible through Moda Mall Gate No.1; Maki has designated parking available with  access through the parking area besides the main entrance. The interiors are ecletic in light brown and paper mache lights at the entrance. Artecrafts beautifully adorn the entrances  without disturbing the contours. Simple and elegant seating makes the ambience warm especially for dinner with family. Pleasantly surprised to see a variety of vegetarian dishes on the menu. Kudos for including red rice and gluten free dishes too. The red rice dishes were delicious with lingering flavour. Variety of sushi with fresh ingredients satiate the non vegetarians too. Service is quick and staff are congenial. The highlight of the evening was the desert "" Fusion Surprise"" which  resembled a mushroom. This heavenly masterpiece has a base layer of green tea, middle portion is a soft white body infused with a filling of berry puree and capped with a circular topping of hard  milk chocolate enclosed in two chocolate  discs . Warm chocolate sauce is then poured just before you indulge in devouring this experience. Thankyou Ruksana for recommending this desert. Thankyou Vinish of client service for patiently explaining the ingredients of the desert while pouring the warm chocolate sauce.

Experience.
The waitress said ""no menu book/card"". She said all the menu. We wait for 45minutes to get our meals. Suddenly someone from the kitchen yelling... the owner scolding the waitress because not yet prepare for the fried rice. Environment not so good eventhough beach just aside.

Taste and price.
For me the taste just so-so if compare with my previous experience at another restaurant. The price considered as expensive. A plate of prawn mee is RM20 and crab mee is RM35. Normally the price of prawn mee in penang island around RM10-RM15",Business,2018-02-28

The Mee Udang gravy lost to other neighbouring stalls as it tasted like Mee Jawa & the prawn broth is normal. The Fried Prawns was cooked perfectly & the flesh was succelent to the last bite.

I have seen some great and not so great reviews about this place but as I truly love Moroccan food I wanted to see it by myself. After a long walk trying to find the venue I finally got there and I must say the place is nicely decorated with a Moroccan style and flair, the menu selection is good and they also propose some cocktails and wines but to my surprise no Moroccan tea. Anyhow, I ordered a ‚Äúcouscous royal‚Äù, my all time favourite and was expecting a nice meal for the night. It did not took too long for the fish to arrive but the old gentleman who brought the food and started to serve the semoule was not so friendly and engaging. Never mind, the most important was the food and when I started to get all the items, which were brought is 4 different plates, it looks really great. Unfortunately, after tasting the chicken which was alright, I went to the merguez (sausage) but it was undercooked. I did not wanted to make a fuzz and tried the lamb and the stew but both were blunt, under seasoned and tasteless. The chicken skewer was good but the rest was just not to the expectations. I tried several bites but it was really not enjoyable as Moroccan food without the flavours from the spices and undercooked meat, does not make it a Moroccan dining experience. I bluntly shared my comment to the young gentleman who seemed to be in charge but the reaction was certainly not as I expected. I did not asked for discount or so but merely sharing the experience but it did not appear to be fruitful to them which is a pity. Maybe I was expecting too much from this evening dinner or maybe it was just not the night for the chef/ cook who prepared the dish but it certainly did not give me another reason to return.

The taste was very nice and the bread crisp.

My wife and I visited Medina on the morning of our last day visiting Vancouver. It was around the corner from our hotel and the menu looked promising. We cursed ourselves for not doing the ""reservation by donation"" option when we showed up early enough on a Saturday morning when we discovered a crowd and an up to 45 minutes wait. (The only way they take reservations is if you make a donation to a charity via their website.) No matter, we had time and got ourselves on the list. The wait wasn't too long and the host was very attentive to the waiting area so we didn't feel lost or ignored in the crowd.

She also, after being seated and noticing our server had some delaying complications at another table, came over without being prompted and stepped in to take our order. We felt really well taken care of.

Everything we had was fantastic. The Tea Sparrow English Breakfast tea service was spot on for my wife. The coffee was on point...excellent even. (Sadly, never a guarantee at breakfast restaurants...they got it right here...as strong as it needed to be.)

We both ordered single ""liege waffles""...Belgian style waffles just don't get better than what we were brought...they're inexpensive too...though they can go up quite about with the available add ons which are plentiful...I opted for maple syrup (when in Canada...) and butter (when having waffles...) I really loved it and could see myself gorging myself into a waffle stuper eating liege waffle after leige waffle. Thankfully I had a cruise ship to get on so we avoided that crisis over over-waffleization. (But I could easily fly back for more!)

We also loved the Roasted Potatoes, Smoked Cheddar with Lemon Aioli. The potatoes couldn't have been more perfectly cooked and were an indulgent delight with the smoked cheddar they were mixed with. (The aioli came on the side which is good as I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise of any kind.)

Considering the volume of available and delicious looking vegetarian options on the menu, it's a miracle we got out after only waffles and potatoes...but, Harissa Burger (vegetarian option available), Paella, egg dishes and couscous...plus the fantastic coffee and thoughtful drinks of every kind...plus the really well done design and atmosphere of this place...it's no wonder it's Owen Wilson's choice for brunch...it definitely would be ours over and over if we lived in Vancouver.",Couples,2024-06-30

Biryani was average.
Zaafrani tea is good if you squeeze a lemon in it which were available in sufficient quantity.

Not tried: chicken reshmi kabab, chana, puri, halwa, shahi tukre, custard, panjeeri and pudding.

Personally I am not a great fan of Japanese cuisine, and certainly not of sushi, so this experience, which is one of the best dinning experiences I have had in years, came as a complete and welcome surprise.

The service is friendly, professional and attentive, yet as in all great restaurants was not intrusive. 

The food is all top quality and freshly prepared. The salmon tartare was exquisite, the sushi rapidly demolished by my colleagues - and I even managed to eat one piece - which in itself is a signature event given how much I dislike Sushi!

With a perfectly cooked steak and sides of  asparagus and oyster mushrooms I was left with an explosion of delicious tastes and flavors. The oyster mushrooms were particularly notable for the originality of the dish.

This was a truly excellent meal, and I look forward to eating at this restaurant again in the near future. Thank you to the whole team who delivered this fabulous experience.

The cooks in the kitchen and not at all Chinese, they are from other Asian countries.¬†The eight culinary cuisines are Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Szechuan, and Zhejiang. I was lost¬† at which cuisine was the food being served and the waiters knew nothing.
Their food menu looked elaborate but a disaster.I used to recommend¬†many of my friends and inner-circle about this Restaurant but I doubt I will ever recommend it again.There is a lot of difference between Taiwanese cuisine and Chinese cuisine.

Even though the supervisor and the staffs are apologetic to what happened, I feel that it's worth mentioning to raise some awareness also in behalf of all other customers.

Here's what happened - so me and my friend were eating buffet with hotpot, so while in just half of the hotpot we go get our drinks and to our surprise when we get back to our table it was cleared already. Most of the time, we always taken vegetables and meats for the hotpot twice so imagine this is just the first one and we're just half way down eating. It's really, really bad experience. And take note, this is not the first time it happen. The first one, since it's first so you just somewhat let it pass. So now for sure, you understand why I need to make a review about it.

749437287,8526065,1462,5,2020-03-06T05:02:25Z,One of the best Indian meals in Qatar,"My wife and spent a lazy afternoon wandering the Old Souq in Al Wakra and decided to have dinner somewhere in the area to end the day.  Most of the restaurants in the OS are located along the beach, called Sea Side.  We had a look at the various venues and menus and settled on Barahat because we are fans of Indian cuisine.  Our experience was outstanding. 

We sat outside on the terrace.  It was a little cool this time of year, but pleasant.  They don't have outside heaters or blankets.  The latter would be a good idea to have on hand.  The service was excellent -- the waitress was knowledgable and able to explain everything we asked about, very polite and attentive, and always eager to help with any need.  We ordered the butter chicken and the prawn tikka masala curries, along with garlic naan bread and raita.  They served poppadams with a dipping sauce as complementary items.  They also gave us a taste of a new item for the drink menu, a kind of lassi or shake made with pomegranate.  Very good.  

In fact, every dish was outstanding.  The shrimp and chicken were tender and properly cooked, the gravies were thick and masterfully spiced, and the naan bread was among the best we have had in Doha.  We often find it is too dry in many restaurants.  Here it was buttery and had just the right amount of garlic.  The raita was also thick and luxurious, very refreshing due to the grated cucumber.  I asked for additional spices because my wife prefers milder food.  The waitress brought me three condiments -- a bottle of hot sauce, Kashimiri chilli powder, and a third that featured cracked black pepper and something else I could not identify.  All good and a nice spectrum of heat options. We had lemon-mint drinks with our meal.  

One of the owners (we think) stopped by our table near the end of the meal to thank us for our patronage and ask about our experience.  He was very nice and informed us that they are developing new dishes and to please return to try them.  We certainly will!

The total for our bill was 142 QAR.  A good deal for a great meal.",NONE,2020-03-31

Service is woeful. No one comes to attend, or check in after food arrives. Food was rubbish. We ordered calamari starter. Overcooked giant rings in layers of thick batter. Like trying to chew a mini car tyre. Embarrassing. Chicken/rice main dish was 5/10 at best. Chicken was dry and the rice pretty tasteless. But edible at least.

This was perhaps my 3rd visit this year, the most recent one being last Friday. As always, its the amazing service & the incredible people which has attracted me to this bar & made it one of my favorites in the city.

The front desk was welcoming as usual, Pathitta and team with their beaming smiles & friendly demeanour. Next, it was a pleasure to be greeted by my favourite bartenders Biki and Cecille. Cecille knew my usual drink & made sure to prepare that 'Old fashioned' to perfection! Kennedy, who is part of the security team & always a delight to talk to, made sure I had a comfortable seat at the counter in the open space of the bar & updated me on the new changes/offers. 

The weather is changing in Doha & I cannot recommend a better place to enjoy drinks on a weekend, with a fantastic view of the beach & the city skyline. In fact, I've always preferred the outside terrace/balcony area the most, at Manko. 

Looking forward for more amazing winter evenings at Manko. 

In a city with so many bars & clubs, a key distinction for any place, in my opinion, is always the service & the people behind it. And in that category, Manko is second to none, for me.

954842161,15273210,1401,5,2024-06-12T14:58:48Z,Exquisite Peruvian Cuisine in an Elegant Setting,"A few years ago, I had the pleasure of dining at La Mar in Doha, and it left me thoroughly impressed. My recent dinner with a colleague reaffirmed that initial impression. La Mar is undoubtedly a refined, elegant restaurant that offers South American, particularly Peruvian, dishes with a slightly fusion and creative twist, crafted by renowned Peruvian chef Acurio.

Among the many delightful dishes I tried, the classic fish ceviche stood out the most. It was genuinely moving, leaving a lasting impression that stayed with me long after the meal. The other dishes were equally of high quality, showcasing the chef's expertise and creativity.

While Lamar is positioned within the mid-to-high price range, the experience is certainly worth the cost. The impeccable service, sophisticated ambiance, and outstanding food make it a place I eagerly anticipate returning to. The explosion of flavors and the combination of tastes are simply breathtaking.

A full rating is absolutely deserved for La Mar. Everything, from the service to the atmosphere, was excellent. Kudos to the kitchen team for maintaining such an elevated standard of cuisine, providing an unforgettable dining experience.",Business,2024-06-30

From the moment we entered, the service & level of excellence was very apparent.
The manager provided us with a detailed overview of the dishes and the recommendations were amazing.  Having just spent close to 6 weeks in Europe, where we ate at a number of great restaurants this was equal to or better quality & the service was head and shoulders above.

949034785,8002072,1399,2,2024-05-01T06:34:36Z,Sadly underwhelming,"I‚Äôve always found Nobu to be one of those ‚Äúsure things‚Äù that lives up to expectations wherever you are in the world, with our first experience over 20 years ago when living in Tokyo.

As a frequent diner at Nobu since moving to Doha, we recently visited for a celebratory meal & were greatly disappointed with the overall experience, save for the valet parking.

The ambience remains the same albeit a little dated, & the serving staff pleasant albeit not overly attentive; however the main disappointment was the overall quality of the dining experience.

We ordered the Doha Omakase, assured that we would get a broad selection of Nobu‚Äôs finest over 9 courses.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, overall the food & presentation was very nice, however it wasn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd consider Nobu quality nor worth the QR 750pp for the set. It also did not include any of Nobu‚Äôs signature dishes.

At best I‚Äôd say the meal was on par with an average Japanese restaurant & lacked anything close to ‚Äúwow‚Äù, explaining why I didn‚Äôt bother to take any photos to capture the moment.

We politely advised our server at the end of the meal that we were underwhelmed by the Omakase experience, where he advised us that ‚Äúit‚Äôs the chef‚Äôs choice‚Äù followed quickly by ‚Äúwould like to add a gratuity?‚Äù.

I guess it shows that the bigger they come, the harder they fall, & when you‚Äôre in a city like Doha, ‚Äúbrand‚Äù complacency may mean the quality doesn‚Äôt have to meet expectations.

Of course there is no shortage of top-quality Japanese or Japanese-fusion restaurants in Doha to choose from, so Nobu‚Äôs loss doesn‚Äôt mean we have to forgo a top quality dining experience in the future.",Couples,2024-04-30

We visited the Italian restaurant Piaceri da Gustare, because last year we really liked the preparation and quality of the food, as well as the service in this restaurant.
And you know - you were not mistaken, the restaurant maintains its brand, very good quality of dishes, a wide range of drinks, excellent service, everything remains at the same level.
I would especially like to note the Italian incharge Prosenjit, who treats each visitor with great attention, and will also help in choosing dishes and drinks, and his greatest advantage is his kindness, understanding and responsiveness. Experienced professional and leader.
I would also like to mention the waiter who served us several times - this is Chinedu. A great guy, sincere and responsive, attentive to visitors. In my opinion, he deserves a promotion in his career.
Now about the cuisine - the dishes are always hot, prepared with soul, and taste excellent. I recommend visiting this restaurant. There is also live music in the restaurant - this is also very important for a good mood.
We express our special thanks to the entire restaurant team for the excellent service and friendly atmosphere! We wish you all the best! Success and prosperity!",Family,2024-06-30

Their biryani is ok, the grill is good well. 

Their best item is denitely their paratas! 
They have the plain, potato (aloo wala) and minced meat (keeme wala) versions of them.

Food was prepared and brought quite fast and all our ordered meals were huge. So it was quite enough to order three meals for five people and share them among us. It was also quite pleasant to have complimentary soups and vegetable salads with ordered meals from the restaurant - a practice which I have also encountered in some other restaurants in UAE. What I did not like in Sadaf is their lack of friendliness with even simple technologies. They provide clients printed menus with few pictures of meals and simultaneously bring ipads to show pictures of other meals, desserts, etc. However, they have no even prices attached to the pictures, so you have to look them again in printed menu for the prices, or ask waiter when you suddenly find out that those aren‚Äôt in menu at all‚Ä¶ Our main waiter seemed little enthusiastic in advising us not only about meals, but also about complimentary soups and salads, so we ordered and then cancelled same salads‚Ä¶ same waiter in turn was quite fast to check the tips we had left when leaving‚Ä¶
Luckily, we were not served by that single waiter only, and we had much better communication with other waiters serving us‚Ä¶ So I believe, a little more training will be better for some personnel and updating ipad photos with prices and descriptions would be of much better convenience for foreign clients.
By the way, the first floor of Sadaf has a small store that offers Persian sweets, dates, nuts and other tasty food to take with you. 
Overall it‚Äôs a good place to visit, especially given the quality food and good prices (spent around 160 dirhams for our family lunch).",Family,2023-07-31

We then settled on a seafood platter and bratwurst with sauerkraut. (The only bratwurst available was chicken - not sure if there is actually such a thing in Germany!).  So, after that and also because there was only a table of two who were drinking and shisha smoking, not eating, we didn't expect much. However, the seafood was quite amazingly good. A wide variety, cooked to a T and crispy batter on the calamari and fish. Also, not having ever tasted ceviche (Peruvian marinated raw fish) and not knowing what it was, we were all completely hooked. At 110 dhs and enough for two people, we thought it good value.  So full marks on that, not so much on the German dish and service and atmoshphere mediocre, but we would definitely go again for the seafood.",Family,2018-04-30

Location is easy to find, ample amount of parking available. Few of the staffs are good,kind and few of them are absolute nonsense. Was very excited for the meter long kebab until i went inside the restaurant but was really disappointed at the time of leaving.

Food is average. Nothing great or out of the box about it. The khaboos and hummos were good. Kebab were also ok. So the excitement started with ordering 1 meter long chicken kebab along with hummos. The arab staff confirmed for the chicken kebab in english and arabic and then went further in process. But we were served with mutton kebab, thats when the excitement died.

We asked the staff that we are served something which we do not prefer to eat in most of the restaurants.so please change this item with chicken, which was what we originally ordered. What we were told was even more disturbing. The manager said we would only replace it to half a meter chicken and you would have to pay for 1meter full. To explain it we felt embarassed and it took 15-20mins to make them underatand that its not our fault if we order chicken and you come up with mutton.

One of them even said we do not have chicken right now so we got mutton. And i was shocked hearing this. If something is not available first inform us, if we are ok then go forward. How can you decide what we want to have. The next shocking thing was a philipino staff came up to us appologized for everything and said, NEXT TYM WHEN YOU VISIT US PLEASE ORDER FOOD TO ONE OF US AND AVOID ARABIC SPEAKING STAFF. I think when you visit an arab cusine restaurant you are suppose to order or use to order an arab staff but here the case is different..

After a long argument and waiting of around 30-40mins we were s√®rved chicken kebab 1 meter but by then we were full with the arguments itself

Overall leaving the argument and wrong dish served, the food is just average especially the chicken. Hummos and khaboos served are great in taste. Its worth a try once. But always remember you give your order to an non arab staff. For me its a thumbs downüñìüñì",Family,2017-09-30

First impressions, the place needs a good scrub, everything feels grimy. We had to ask the waitress to wipe the table as it was obviously greasy, however it‚Äôs clear cleanliness is definately not their strong point

Most guests are there to smoke Shisha and nothing else. That should have been our cue of what was to come.

The restaurant was nice, undergoing some renovations- I can't comment on the food as I only had a thick shake, however that was nice.  There were dummy looking cakes.

The outside area is very nice, and it would be an excellent place to chill for the day with the family.  The water was clear, and had small surfeable waves .  There are other water sports that can be done.

There is also a "" tarzan"" gym, with all the weights made out of wood which was quite nice !!  Upstairs is a yoga area, which would be an excellent experience overlooking the water.

You can stay there overnight, however the huts did not look very well maintained - maybe because its summer and not really an option ( they are open air).

Some improvements- the bathrooms were not that clean.  The restaurant temperature, while not too bad, could do with some better quality A/C.",Solo travel,2024-07-31

We tried to call Lumi beach to ask if any changes for saturday since we could not fetch such info anywhere on their website but no answer.
We arrived and learnt that the weekend program is outsourced n run by ''holidate'', we were told that the entry is 200dhs per person and NON redeemable.
When we challenged the ladies at the reception about lack of communication, they seemed clueless and helpless, they themselves discovered that this info was nowehere clearly featured for guests and new comers.
They had to blame it on the resort especially when we showed them that indeed we tried to contact the hotel prior to driving there all the way from Dubai but No one picked the calls.

Lumi beach if you are a hotspot in town, it means that your reputation is at stake and you need to keep working hard towards customers' satisfaction and clients' centricity.
BE REACHABLE and BE TRANSPARENT. Empower your ground teams and partners to deal with such cases and be able to offer clients' solutions to such mishaps.

Crispy, crunchy morsels of chicken chunks which gives you a good vibes. 
Biryani was flavorful not too spicy not too flat a well balanced spice level. Will surely order again from this place. A must try for all #Malabar #Biryani lovers like me. Highly Recommended!

As long as i can remember they have the same red & white decor being it their walls or tables and chairs. A refurbishment is required for sure. Plenty of seating available and can accommodate a party easily with its duplex architecture.

Our Meal started of with a complimentary Sweet Corn Soup which was thick and a bit blunt in taste. A plate of Salad accompanied along with the soup.

Munched ourselves with a plateful of yum Hummus and tasteful Garlic Paste with pita bread till our mains arrived.

Opted for the 1KG Mix Grill which included soft, scrumptious and juicy meat kababs and tasteful chicken pieces with Fries and cut Paratha as sides. Was extremely palatable. A bite into the chicken piece took me back by surprise with its amazing flavor and tenderness.

Next had the Chicken Tikka. Served were a platful of Chicken pieces which were grilled just right and flavorful as well. Fries and paratha accompanied as sides here as well.

With a variety of grill items to broasted chicken meals to choose from that too not being heavy on your pockets, Hi broast is the place to be. Quick and courteous service in addition to amazing food is always a winner.

Almost everything here is delicious. The Pahadi & Reshmi rolls are amazing. The buttered paavs - definitely Bombay. The last time I tasted similar rolls were at Nizams in Connaught place, New Delhi. Never had anything close in the last 25 years. 
Servers are enthusiastic and smart. There was just one dish none of us liked, some kind of an egg gravy with burji. Maybe it didn't taste so good cos we asked for less spice. I am sure it can be better.  
Do try the Kulfis. After your heavy meal, it is big enough to be shared by two people.   
A pleasant and nostalgic experience, the Bombay days decades ago when even street food was hygienic.

@rajuomlet is an eggcelent place and I had an opportunity to visit their Safeer Mall Sharjah branch on a weekday for a delicious breakfast. I used to visit their Al Qouz branch back in 2016-2017 as it was in front of my previous office building for lunch and tea.

@rajuomlet has a total of 5 branches all over Dubai and they are popular for breakfast, lunch & dinner. This is the first UAE restaurant chain that has earned the distinction of being featured in the Harvard Business Review.

Their cafe decor is very welcoming, funky, and attractive, as you will find egg pictures with some good quotes, old musical instruments & Bollywood comic posters.

This place is an eggsecutive community and they have a huge variety of egg dishes from Half Fry to all kinds of Omelette styles with amazing desi flavors as they use fresh eggs and chicken with no antibiotics or hormones from @aljazirapoultry.

693477078,3921821,1178,5,2019-07-28T13:43:02Z,Constant food quality,"Chow King is one of my favourite fast food chains in all of UAE, as they are always consistent with their offerings.
Having so many items on the menu, you would think that the order might be messed up sometimes or things are not up to par, but this is never the case at Chow King. The quality and taste are always consistent, you can expect your favourite item to taste the same way you remember it, each time you order it.

 

It is always a nice day to order the desserts that Chow King offers, regardless of the time of year. They are perfect in every way. Whether you order the Halo Halo (best seller), Buko Pandan, or anything else, Chow King does it right. When it comes to desserts and sweets, it is easy to put in too much sugar, which makes the dish unnecessarily sweet, on top of the sweetness that already comes from the jelly.

 

I consider the desserts at Chow King to rival the likes of Baskin Robbin and Haagen Daz. The taste is different but they are unique in their own way.",Couples,2019-04-30

The food was well packaged, came with extra sauces and dips as well as unordered poppadoms and was still hot, but it was a takeaway order that was delivered to me and there was no cutlery to eat it with (thankfully my hotel room had extra). The Mutton Rogan Josh lacked flavor and was very oily. Normally there would be loads of sauce that you can dip your poppadoms or naan bread in but this dish was so oily that it was unpleasant dipping anything and there was just a little sauce at the bottom but when you mixed it to the top would just sink under a very oily layer. The flavor was mediocre- I enjoy Rogan Josh whenever I travel to the Middle East and Asia, as well as some really good Indian restaurants around the world, and I would have to say that this was probably my worst one ever. If it hadn‚Äôt been that it was very, very oily, I would perhaps have rated it slightly higher but the flavor was really lacking. If I had paid full price I would have been extremely disappointed. The naan bread was ok but the saffron rice was really good. I would like to give them another go with a different meal and hopefully they surprise me next time.",Business,2024-05-31

Not the 5 star experience ive been used to in dubai the 9 years ive been visiting, nor what would be expected at such an establishment. Honestly my first review I've given less than 4 stars. They offered to give us more starters but we just wanted to move onto the mains. We didn't get the desert we picked for some reason (we had selected one which looked unique) and got a basic chocolate plate with browine pieces on it which was nothing special. Food came timely and was good but service was sub-par as the waiters just stand around and aren't attentive. Nothing was set out for my anniversary either and i had stated this on my booking. 

You get 2 complementary plates and have to purchase more to throw and the focus on the entertainment is on whoever spends the most.

We all probably tried food that we would not normally choose ourselves and that was an added benefit.

92634240,1575576,1064,2,2011-01-12T06:17:31Z,Strange hotel!,"It was quite a challenge to book this place as it does not have a website. I had to email one of the previous tripadvisor reviewers to get the phone number as I couldn't find it anywhere. So, for reference the phone number is 25427191. The email address is reservation@duqmguesthouse.com but I have not verified that this works. Anyway, we spent a night here to break the drive between Muscat and Salalah. From the outside it looks more like a labour camp than a hotel (high fence, floodlights, portacabins) though this is explained by the fact that, despite being called ""Duqm Tourist Guest House""  it is run by an engineering company for contractors rather than for tourists. It is pretty much the same type of accomodation as the camps in the oil fields. It was apparently built as a temporary facility and is therefore deteriorating rapidly. Despite being less than 2 years old, the floors are in bad condition as are the bathrooms and the carpets are heavily stained (cream was probably an unusual colour choice though!).  The rooms are portacabins with ensuite bathrooms and come as standard single or suite king. There are no twins and no standard doubles. The suite has a large living room with leather sofa and large flat screen TV which is one of the best features of the place. However it is quite expensive at OMR41 for the suite and OMR30 for the standard single on a bed and breakfast basis. So we paid OMR100 for 4 people as we needed a double and 2 singles since there were no twins. As a comparison we normally pay about OMR20-25 for a double at various resthouses in Oman which often includes dinner. So this place costs about double and is only marginally better. The restaurant has a suprisingly wide range of food - Indian, Chinese and Western (no Arabic) though again quite pricey for this kind of place. We had a curry but it came cold - the staff were more interested in serving some locals that they were fawning over. The service in the restaurant is a bit clueless despite the number of staff and their smart uniforms. Breakfast was very limited - again it was similar to the basic resthouses which charge half the price. So, basically, this is the only place to stay in Duqm at the moment as far as I know, and one of the few options for breaking the Muscat to Salalah journey, especially on the coastal route, so beggars can't be choosers. I do feel though that it has probably gone downhill quite a bit since the other rewiews, and since the Lonely Planet glowing report,  so I have tried to give a realistic and balanced description.",Family,2011-01-31

Even though we did not order dinner it was provided which was a minor issue given our cash situation.

873417632,19526578,1058,2,2022-12-31T09:16:26Z,Up there with my oddest hotel experiences,"I booked a room at this hotel on an internet BOOKING website, printed off my confirmation voucher and planned my road trip. My voucher stated that I would pay the hotel upon arrival.

When I arrived, there was nobody at check-in, and I had to wander into a backroom to ask someone to check me in. They called another member of staff, who arrived with his shirt open, and proceeded to study my booking voucher at great length, but had no knowledge of the booking and no idea what to do with the voucher.

He seemed to imply that I was all paid up (which I wasn't), and I then witnessed two men storming out, refusing to pay for their room. Rather than deal with the matter discreetly, they allowed the full disagreement to play out very vocally in front of me for several minutes, while I was still waiting to be given a room after a five hour drive.

I was finally given a room key, and told where to find my room (first floor).

In fairness, the room was large, air-conditioned, and the bed was large, and I would guess the hotel was clean, because it's fully tiled and you could smell disinfectant everywhere. So I can't fault them on that.

However, the bed wasn't comfortable, there was no towel in the bathroom and no toilet paper either (thank God there was a box of tissues!).

I always knew my stay would be functional ... I just needed a bed to break the drive between Muscat and Salalah. But I was so unnerved, I woke up at 3am , after 4 hours sleep, wanting to check out and leave, but forcing myself to wait till 6am, in case there was nobody on reception and they tried to accuse me of sneaking out.

Even though the half dressed guy that checked me in said I was fully paid (like I say, he'd never seen the BOOKING website voucher, and didn't read it), I paid a different guy in the morning and made sure to ask for a receipt.

Would I recommend? Maybe as an alternate to driving through the night or sleeping in your car ... Unless you have a big car.

And definitely take your own towel and toilet paper.",Solo travel,2022-12-31

I DON'T EVEN THINK IT COULD GET WORSE THAN THIS.

The staff looks down on people who are supposed to be their ""guests"". They don't deserve to be working in the HOSPITALITY sector.

They don't have a system and the decency to be courteous to their ""guests"". Just the simple task of getting a copy of your passport is tedious. Lining up to schedule your bus trip back to UAE is a horror. We had to line up from 12 midnight on a SATURDAY to book for the next trip which was the next TUESDAY. The queue got so long that everyone was fighting for their spot because the management is such a power trip that they stopped booking the list since WEDNESDAY even if people had their visas already. When we didn't make it to the list travelling for Tuesday, they didn't enlist us despite lining up since the wee hours of the morning. They wanted us to LINE UP AGAIN THE NEXT DAY (SUNDAY) for the trip on the next WEDNESDAY. One time when I approached the front desk warmly, the staff there asked me, ""What do you want?!"" --WHAT KIND OF HOTEL IS THIS?! I WAS BAFFLED AND DISGUSTED.

As for the rooms, they are full of roaches, and the bed linens and mattresses look like props for a spooky show. The doors don't have locks, and again, THERE IS NO PROCESS. Which could have been a bit tolerable if the staff didn't act like they were above everyone else. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE SERVING THEM INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

WIFI is only available on the lobby, and is veeeery slow. NO HOUSE-KEEPING. You clean your own room, like really clean it like it's your house. Good luck again with the foul stench and the roaches.

I HAVE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THEM ALL. JUST PLEASE, IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME, MONEY, AND DIGNITY, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GOLD-DIGGING, DISRESPECTFUL, DIRTY PLACE.

How? they will simply 'delay' your booking for bus back to uae, even if you have your new uae visa already 
(mine was issued 2 days after my exit). I waited 2weeks before i got scheduled! while others waited for a month!!

And, they will HOLD your passport even if you request to check-out and take public transpo or plane instead, so you have no choice but to wait for booking.

We enjoyed the climate and heat regulated swimming pool, that was a surprise, we loved it.  Chefs did a great job on serving the best BBQ's, Sumptuous Dinner spread & Breakfast was great. Resort Manager Mr Ganga, Chef Manoj & Arabic Chef showcased the best cuisine and 5* services.
Camel ride was set the following day- beauties they are!  Worth the trip.

- It is far away for the center of the city, you have to drive for 40 minutes approx.

Watchingthe turtles -even in November- was a wonderful experience. Several turtles were burying their eggs and then returned to the sea. Most memorable was the birth of the baby turtles. We saw them literally crawl out of the sand. It was so cute.

The staff on reception and in the restaurant were really helpful and the Indian food was good. The karak was great in the morning.

The hotel sits in a beautiful stretch of coast and there is a nice viewpoint to watch the sun go down.  It was quiet until visitors turned up from elsewhere for the noisy evening tours. 

One thing I didn‚Äôt like was the attached museum which had a shockingly sad display of baby turtles. This should be removed. I wasn‚Äôt even sure if they were dead or alive.

It was very rude of them to do so and consider this normal. The next morning they were even asking to pay extra for each matrass. I refused to do that, as I booked a room for 4 persons including the beds which were not there! 

The museum is a joke and during low seasok you can‚Äôt see much of the turtles. They should consider giving a discount during a low season. 

The staff was really unfriendly! We did nit experience any unfriendly people in Oman but at this hotel they were very unfriendly and rude. The parking was full of mud and they did not even try to make it approachable for their guests. Parking at own risk! Dinner was 12 Omr per person! That is a lot!!

My experience started from the moment I parked the car at the entrance of the village and crossed the old village on foot. It might be uncomfortable to carry your luggage, but the deeper you go into the plantations, the more you feel you enter a different world. When I reached the heritage inn after 10 minutes of walking, I felt disconnected from the outside world, relaxed, and excited to find a new lifestyle.

In particular, I loved the geometrical mud-imprinted ornaments in my room. I would have looked at the palm trees from my balcony for hours. At the same time, I also enjoyed the darkness created by the massive wooden shutters that helped me to have a profound and restful sleep. In the morning, I sat doing nothing on the breakfast terrace for one hour. This revealed to me the hidden sounds of nature, the blessing of the shade, and the remoteness of the place. Not only that I connected to the energy of place and nature, but I also connected deep within myself. After a long and agitated travel, I admitted how much I needed a restorative place to recharge myself.

Misfah Old House is more than a guesthouse with rooms for rent, and even more than a heritage inn. In fact, it is a place where time stops and you travel into the depth of your inner being. It is a place where you meet the secrets of the local lifestyle and immerse in the lively traditions.",Solo travel,2023-10-31

The Camp is clearly geared towards large groups and families, and offers different cabins. Everything is easily on the shabby side of things. ""Sunset Chalets"" are a row of rooms built like a terraced house, you get a bed (hard), 2 chairs, a coffee table, a sofa which might serve as a third bed. THAT's it. Nothing else. It is a place to sleep, do not expect anything more. Bathroom very simple, bordering on primitive, cleary in need of urgend maintenance and cleaning. The ""terrace"" is right next to your neighbours with a fire pit, but you are baiscally sitting on top of each other at a primitive picnic table. 
There is a large pool without any frills, and just a few loungers. Restaurant is really simple, buffet style. Again, catering to large , noise groups. Expect the usual Indian staples (admittedly not all bad), but atmosphere and charm of a railway station waiting room. This does not improve for breakfast, either. Everything is crammed into one corner, plastic everywhere.
This place appears to profit from its location only, nothing else to recommend it.",Family,2024-02-29

935689929,12923812,958,5,2024-01-27T06:43:35Z,I have a new Brother! His name is Abdullah. The Al Misfah Hospitality Inn - heaven on Earth a foretaste of the next life,"I've been to a few places, 70 plus countries and can legitimately claim to have ""got the T shirt"" when it comes to travelling. Big head - well yes. But my point is made in this instance NOT to brag but to ""big up"" and illustrate what goes down for me as one of the best hotel/inns of its type ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

And that is down to the vision, passion, belief of the amazing owner Abdullah who now officially is my new best friend and brother.

Entering the old town through an old wooden arch way was a step back in time. The old village clinging to the side of the rock face with newly restored houses and small hotels everywhere around. The warmest of welcomes greeted us from the Reception manager who kindly showed us to our room via the old internal house steps and pictures of HM King Charles on the wall from his previous two visits to this part of Oman.

The Terrace on the third floor offered superb views over a Garden of Eden, a view I'll never forget. Then up again to the restaurant area with even better vistas over the old town. A small flight of stairs lead us to our modern bedroom built with care and a nod to the 400 year old main house. Inside all the luxuries of a 5 star hotel.

In traditional Omani custom, coffee and dates were served and we realised that the AMHI was a very special place.

But the best was yet to come. Abdullah, the owner. This former military man cares about his family, village and wider community. He wants to help protect Al Misfah for future generations and without doubt he will achieve this objective. 

Funny, charamatic, informative, knowledgable, kind, generous - I am all of these, but in this instance I am of course talking about Abdullah, who will, I hope be my guest should he ever come to the UK. He spent so much time sharing his historical knowledge, where to go, what to do and even booked us a restaurant for my wife's birthday at a mates restaurant in Nizwa. This man is a legend.

Any criticism? To be picky the food whilst very good and plentiful perhaps was a bit ""samey"" on the two nights we were there. But look, this isn't about the food. It's about the virtual spiritual experience guests get from staying at this wonderful Omani Inn.

You really won't find better anywhere in the World. Trust me, I have that T shirt remember.

Thank you Abdullah, your new best friend - ŸÖÿßÿ±ŸÉ",Couples,2024-01-31

The other reason is that whilst the food was decent, some items on their menu they didn't actually have.

The hotel is worn and tired throughout and needs some serious inward investment to bring it up to scratch. Rooms are clean and are a good size with large comfortable beds but everything is just in need of upgrade. Sound insulation is poor and you hear all noise from the corridor in your room. Breakfast is buffet style and is actually very good with a broad selection but is an interesting affair nonetheless. The young lady who takes the room numbers also manages the toaster which results in people waiting around for toast instead of moving on to the buffet proper. This causes a significant log-jam of people being made to wait to give in their room numbers and get their breakfast started. The shining light of the hotel has to be the ladies on reception who are all really lovely, bubbly people. The pool is quite nice, and very clean, but there are only 5 sun beds and they are a very basic design of canvass on a metal frame with cross support bars that offer no comfort. We ate in the hotel restaurant once and the food was very good but it‚Äôs quite expensive. If you step out of the hotel and turn left it‚Äôs about a 12 minute walk to a small commercial area where there are a number of local restaurants at much lower prices. There are also shops and banks. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle bus to the airport.",NONE,2019-12-31

Unfortunately, the weather was windy and quite cool the first 2 days and I found my room very chilly because the a/c seemed to only have a cooling function. In the end I left it off the whole time but the room still stayed surprisingly cold and I had to wear a fleece inside. That aside, the room was good. Spacious with a big, comfortable bed, sofa and free standing desk. I would have liked better lighting but I particularly like bright lights and others may not have minded so much. The bathroom was well fitted out with a walk in shower. There was a kettle, fridge, iron and ironing board. Water was provided in a reusable glass bottle which is great to see. There was a balcony with table and chairs and a view of a channel. Beyond the channel was a not so scenic construction site. 

My package included breakfast and dinner. The food was okay - not outstanding - but mostly good enough. There is a big supermarket (Lulu Hypermarket) just 100 meters from the front gate so you can always stock up a bit there if need be.  

The hotel seemed almost empty on the first night but swarms of UAE-based ex-patriots and their appallingly behaved children arrived the next day making for a less restful experience, The children seemed to just be turned loose and ran screaming around the walkways outside the rooms and yelled in the restaurant. Breakfast on my final morning was so crowded that guests had to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. This was partly due to Ramadan with the outside tables not in use after sunrise but also all the families seemed to want to eat at the same time. 

At check out I was happy to be leaving them all behind for an airport business hotel in Muscat. The Atana is a reasonably good hotel. Pity about the children.",Solo travel,2024-03-31

It was a sudden trip and arrangements were made literally in the last 2 days prior to leaving from Qatar.
My friends had suggested Intercity Hotel for our Salalah stay for our family of 4 (including 2 boys). It was a pleasant experience and we enjoyed the hospitality given. In particular by Mr.Fernandez, in the reception.
We arrived at 10 am from Muscat and we were obliged with an early check in (luckily because the Khareef season had not yet started). Also our request for interconnecting rooms was accommodated. The kids room had a small balcony and we got to spend some time chatting there in the late evenings !
On the last day, our return flight to Doha was in the late night and again Mr.Fernandez helped with a concessional fare for the half day stay beyond their usual 12 noon check out timing.
Also he was very helpful in charting an itinerary for our 3 day stay.
The breakfast spread was good too, though I can imagine it can be pretty crowded when the khareef season starts!
The hotel is well located, just a walkable distance from the Sultan Qaboos mosque (which is one of the places to visit) and there are a choice of eateries a little walk away. Also ATMs are nearby (which I find preferable to money exchange joints).
Altogether we had an enjoyable stay in this property and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to those travelling to Salalah.
We did not have time to experience their gym and swimming pool facilities.
We hope to come again next year during the season (July-Sept) when the full natural beauty of Salalah can be experienced.

The common facilities (dining, outdoor lounging, outdoor pool, activity offers) are relatively new and very nice, in bizarre contrast to the (very poor) rooms. If we were only to rate the rooms, I would give it a 1 or 2 rating, but the location if gorgeous and common facilities are nice. 

The rooms are really awful and simply bizarre compared to the newer common areas. The location on the beach and ""casual"" feel of the area is what attracted us to book and loved the look (online) of the outdoor bathrooms. We travel extensively in Southern Africa and are used to and love accommodation in nature areas with outdoor bathrooms/showers, etc.  Muscat Hills totally misses the call with the rooms. The materials are ""natural"" but dusty and filthy dirty. The furnishings in our room were certainly not ""Omani"" as claimed. Not all the electrical outlets worked. The hairdryer or the outlet I plugged into blew up my electrical adapter.  Once this happened my husband when to the reception to get a new hairdryer, since it didn't work, but the office was locked up.  I tried to call the number  given to us but with no answer.  The toilet base was not secured to the floor and the hanging towel rail, with towels on it, draped on our heads when we sat on the unsecured loo. The lighting in the rooms and bathroom is minimal and rooms are extremely small. 
Sticker shock (besides the overpriced room for what it is):  alcohol was not served in the restaurant or beach area until 8:00pm so we had 2 beers and 1 individual (small) bottle of wine from the room frig. Cost: over $50.00.  There may have been a price list somewhere in the room to indicate to overpriced bar goods, but it either wasn't there or we couldn't see it with the poor lighting.

We arrived a few hours earlier than check in time however after an hour they were able to give us a room and we were given courtesy drinks whilst waiting. Room was spacious and the room service was very good with the usual daily cleaning. Room had iron board/iron. There are two swimming pools, not very deep (1.2m) so perfect to children and those that cannot swim too well. The view from the pool is beautiful, overlooking the sea. You can walk down to a private beach which is lovely and swimming in the sea is a must. It‚Äôs not deep at all so do check it out. The breakfast is very good with a lot of variety. They have a live section where you can order different types of eggs/omelettes and veg dosa. They have a large variety of fruits, pastries and cakes. Jacklin is very courteous and always has a smile. I cannot fault the restaurant one bit, the service and food was all amazing. We really felt welcomed each morning.

958401454,299166,854,1,2024-07-07T11:04:12Z,Disappointing Experience at Crowne Plaza Muscat - Urgent Need for Improved Service,"Dear Management Team of Crowne Plaza Muscat,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the unacceptable service I experienced during breakfast on my last day at your hotel, today, July 7th. Despite my best efforts to remain calm and understanding, I cannot overlook the clear instances of discrimination and preferential treatment that marred what should have been a pleasant dining experience.

Twice during breakfast, my order was delayed, and I had to remind the waitstaff o my order before it was finally served to me. What added insult to injury was the fact that I observed a pattern of quicker and more attentive service being provided to a white couple seated just a few feet from me. On both occasions, despite placing the same order ahead of them, they received their order first while I was left waiting.

I am under no illusion that such behavior reflects an explicit policy of the IHG group, but the impact of feeling undervalued and marginalized based on my skin color and nationality is undeniable. This was not an isolated incident (it happened twice within an hour) but a disturbing pattern that raises serious concerns about the level of service and equality at your establishment.

When I raised my concerns with Santosh, the manager on duty that morning, his apology fell short of addressing the underlying issue. Blaming busyness for the subpar service is unacceptable; all guests, regardless of the circumstances, deserve to be treated with respect and fairness. Moreover, the excuse that the white guest falsely claimed my order as hers further underscores the need for better employee training to handle such situations professionally and without bias. I know this as I was amusedly observing that guest sneak a few cans of Diet Pepsi in her bag. 

I strongly urge you to take immediate action to rectify these shortcomings in your service standards. Training programs on diversity, inclusion, and customer service must be implemented to ensure that every guest receives the same level of exceptional care and attention, regardless of their background. It is imperative that unconscious biases, if any, among your staff are identified and addressed promptly to prevent such deplorable incidents from recurring.

This experience has left a lasting mark of disappointment and discomfort, which I sincerely hope no other guest has to endure in the future. Your commitment to upholding the highest standards of hospitality must be reflected in the actions taken to prevent such incidents and ensure that all guests are valued equally.

I trust in your swift and vigilant response to this matter and hope that my feedback contributes to fostering a more inclusive and respectful environment at Crowne Plaza Muscat. Thank you for your attention to this urgent concern.

Sincerely,

Mark Vicente / Christian Pirante",Friends getaway,2024-07-31

958920222,10364106,850,1,2024-07-10T16:30:29Z,Mistake,"First of all, I‚Äôm a regular visitor to Muscat as I used to visit Muscat at least once per month for business purposes. I used to stay at this hotel. Every time during my stay I have to change my room for a different reason, once being a smelly room, another time for being noisy. And I used to be patient enough and to tolerate all of these unfortunate situations because of the nice attitude of the staff. 
Until this time I checked in on 9th July. I told the gentleman in the reception during the check in that I need a complementary upgrade as a frequent client (coming an average of 12 times a year) and as a compensation of what happened to me last time resulted in changing my room 2 times although I was staying for only 2 nights.
The gentleman in the reception told me that this is not his decision and he has to refer back to the lobby manager - Mr Qais  (which is totally understood) .. he called him .. and spoke with a non- English language.. and then told me that he refused .. 2 mins later I found him dealing with another client, then he came to me.
I asked him about the reason behind declining my request with a nice smile especially I know that I‚Äôm asking about something complimentary. He answered me aggressively that you need an upgrade we need more money ( yelling his hands with the money sign) 
in a very rude, vulgar and unprofessional way.
I told him that this will not encourage me to book in this hotel again.. he replied (it‚Äôs your call!!!!) Honestly I have been to Muscat more than 25 times. I do like the people there for their acceptance, smile and great hospitality. I can claim that this is the only behavioral issue I have ever faced in whole Oman and unfortunately from a hospitality organization.

The room was spacious and beautiful & the house keeping team were brilliant. We loved the turn down service. The beds were comfortable and the pillow menu was a fabulous addition.

The family pool was lovely and the beach offered so much. The life guards, pool service & Zuka food service were all amazing. The guys were all so good, unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember their names except for Opu who served us most days anr Zuka and was great and attentive. The life guards were brilliant at keeping an eye on the children and provided lots of pool toys. The only thing that let the pool down was some people smoking. There was a separate adult pool which we could not enter with our daughter, so perhaps smoking could be restricted to there. It was quite unpleasant and not something I wanted my daughter to inhale. 

We eat at both Brezza & Peridot. We had the a la carte at both and there were plenty of food options all of which were delicious and great quality. They catered extremely well to our daughter‚Äôs allergies.  The breakfast was also filled with so many choices and was all incredibly delicious. The staff were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. The only down side was not being able to visit Anzo as they did not allow children. It would have been nice to try. 

We also used the kids club, our daughter thoroughly enjoyed some down time here. She was able to get out of the heat and do lots of arts & crafts. The ladies Michelle, Jovy & Shamira were all really lovely and our daughter enjoyed spending time with them. The kids club was clean and well stocked and comfortable. 

We used the concierge service and organised a snorkelling trip through the hotel which was so incredible. We swam with turtles. All equipment and snacks and water were provided, it was a wonderful experience and highly recommended.

It is truly the staff that work here, that make this hotel so special. I have to give special thanks to the following people (sorry for the long review) but they deserve a special mention for being such good people. 

From check in by Jamal (who was so lovely and kind), the moment we walked into this hotel, you could tell it would be a special place, one that we would never forget.

We are staying as a family of 4 with a 6 year old and a 2 year old, the hotel has been incredible with my children, from the wonderful towel set ups to the entertainment. Always including them in conversation and offering them little activities to keep them busy. It has been appreciated so much. The special children‚Äôs place mats at dinner and cutlery, the selection of food really made the children feel included. 

It is so hard to name everyone but the staff at the Peridot restaurant and Tarini lounge are truly outstanding (every single member of staff here deserve huge praise). 

Most notably, Roselyn who was so incredible, she is a shining light at the hotel. Gurang, who was always there with a smile. Jenie, Yaesen, Nayeem, Pradeep and Neeraj. Thank you so much for everything you did to make our stay so memorable. We will miss you so much, we truly felt like we were part of the family. 

They are so attentive, caring and accommodating. You truly feel looked after from the moment you enter to the time you leave. They are incredible! They are highly professional and courteous, the best in the hospitality industry.

Mina the manager at the Peridot restaurant has a clear vision, great planning and organisation. He is an excellent manager, cares for everyone and always ensures you have everything you need. He has outstanding relationships with the guests and the staff. A complete professional who really made our stay extra special. Thank you Mina! 

Thank you to the housekeeping staff who worked in our room, I am sorry I never caught you so cannot name you but they always made up our room beautifully, fresh towels, slippers, eye cream (you will know when you book). They work so hard to keep the hotel so beautifully clean and sparkling. 

The spa overlooks the beach with beautiful views from the massage treatment rooms. The staff outside bring you towels immediately followed by refreshing water, food and ice lollies to your hearts content. Thank you to my hamam and massage therapist, it was so wonderful. 

The gym is 24 hours so really useful to use when the children are asleep. Do not be nervous about travelling here during the summer, it‚Äôs not something you will regret. The staff ensure you have all you need to cope with the heat. 

If you are thinking about booking this hotel, please do so without hesitation. You will not regret it. 

Once again, thank you for everything Jumeirah Muscat Bay and we hope to plan a return trip soon ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

Don‚Äôt bother going until their refurbishments are finished in October - there are no useful amenities available to enjoy a holiday. They offer a transfer to a 4* hotel pool which is not up to par with what they should be offering. The pool is over a 10 minute drive in a dirty, tatty and unsafe transfer bus without seatbelts (which only leaves twice per day).
They were kind and gave me a dessert to celebrate my birthday. However, housekeeping came round before 08:50am, when I was still in my room. I asked them to return later in the day however they didnt, and the fresh fruit on the cake grew mould. There were also marks on the floor from a spilled drink of some sort when I checked in. Given everything was shut, I at least expected the room to be clean. Overall I‚Äôm just so disappointed to have spent so much money on a ‚Äòluxury‚Äô hotel to have such a terrible experience for my birthday. I‚Äôve heard such amazing things about the venue and have no doubt that it will return to it‚Äôs former glory when renovations are done, I just can‚Äôt believe the standards have slipped so much during the interim.

This is my third night at this property and the attitude of the staff has gotten from bad to worse. This place is racist and appears to value the white skinned and the local guests over the others. Every restaurant in the hotel will not greet you on arrival, will not come to you to take the order or will be interested in serving you until asked for. Where as the other nationals who also step in around the same time will be welcomed and are extended warm hospitality. As though we are going to eat a free meal and they are going to pay double. Muscat in July is warm but this hotel is very cold with an unpleasant and unhelpful attitude by the doormen at the entrance or bringing in a wrong order in the restaurant without an apology or billing the birthday cake at trader‚Äôs vic, (not that I mind paying, but at least if I would have known I would have chosen my favourite flavour üòÇ) the annoying ill mannered housekeeping staff that keep ringing the bell to clean the room. The pool too was not well serviced and the lights at one end were not working. There is this sheer unapologetic rude demeanour the staff possess and they completely lack communication and hospitality skills. This place is not worth your time or money. Do not book here..I have travelled to Oman before and stayed at other properties..Omani people are very welcoming and friendly and the staff at our previous hotel I stayed in too were so warm..this hotel is not a representation of Oman or the Middle East.. please do come to Oman it‚Äôs a beautiful place with lovely food and great humans but please do not stay at the Intercontinental.

The hotel needs a massive revamp. They are certainly not a 4 or 5 star. Just barely touching 3 star.

I landed early morning so when I reached hotel it was breakfast time.
Breakfast place is in the basement and very dingy place.
In the breakfast- the offerings were rather limited. Scrambled egg, boiled eggs, baked beans, Aloo Bhaji, cheddar cheese, Cucumber, apple juice, tea and coffee.

Lunch and dinner had limited items but good food.

Swimming pool was good, it was very hot temperature so use of pool came in handy.

The rooms and the toilet needs to be addressed. Bedroom carpets hdad stains on them - wallpapers are peeling off, ventilation doesn't work, mould on all the bathroom corners etc.

957553514,7176193,776,5,2024-07-01T12:35:11Z,Exceptional Service at the Luxurious Four Seasons Hotel Bahrain Bay,"Luxuriously & Meticulously crafted, Four Seasons Hotel in Bahrain leaves no room for disappointment. 
So well designed, beautifully & functionally, this Hotel deserves to win the Cond√© Nast Traveller‚Äôs 2024. 

It could be one of the Best Hotels I‚Äôve visited, so far ü§© 

The overall Hotel Design is so intricate, one would wonder where to go next‚Ä¶ is there any better, in this World? 

Putting Design aside, although I can write about it endlessly, their Service, as any Four Seasons Hotel I have been to, exceeded my Expectations. 
I will not spoil the little details, but they have a way to make your stay and journey wonderful, as most Four Seasons Hotels would do‚Ä¶ undoubtedly. 

Located in the Bahrain Bay, this Hotel is perfectly located in Manama, the Capital city of Bahrain. 
There are many malls around; but if you don‚Äôt have a rented car, you can always try their Taxi Boat that will take you from and to The Avenues, a relatively new Mall in the area. 
I haven‚Äôt personally had the chance to try this experience, but I guess it would be nice to try it during Day Time. 
You can visit a few shops or even have Lunch in renowned restaurants there. 

And so one of the best part at this Hotel, is their Beach area! 
Whether you want to tan or swim near the shore, there is a LifeGuard on duty, but probably not at all times. I think he is responsible for the Swimming Pool side area too. But that‚Äôs not a problem, Four Seasons Bahrain staff is always ready to help. Just ask and they would fulfill your request‚Ä¶ 

Oh and the Swimming Pool.. is so fantastic! 
You should really go for yourself and try this experience‚Ä¶
There is a small Water Park too for children, and an ice cream shop, good for Sunny Summer Days. 

The Beach Club, ventilated by AC, encompasses the Ice Cream shop, a superbly designed BabyFoot, a üéÆ Video Gaming Area and many more‚Ä¶

Many more returns too, I would say ü§© hopefully‚Ä¶

Last but not least, don‚Äôt miss out on a Romantic Dinner at the Cut, managed by Chef Wolfgang Puck and oh! The Spa could be one of the best experiences!! Everrrr

Thank you for the wholesome Journey dear Four Seasons Bahrain Team.  
You have made it exceptional‚Ä¶ 
By all means.

I would definitely recommend this four seasons to any one visiting Bahrain. However, I was told that the promotional price that I paid is no longer available and that the hotel has risen its prices. However, it is worth the experience even if once. The hotel however is not connected to any shopping center and is not in close proximity to any restaurants or market.

956049712,20372730,752,2,2024-06-21T08:42:12Z,Disappointing Stay,"This review details a series of frustrations encountered during my recent stay. While the initial booking process seemed straightforward, with the option to pay upon arrival, I received a confusing message from the hotel requiring immediate payment to confirm the reservation.

Upon check-in, we requested additional beds for two rooms, with the assurance they would be complimentary and suitable for two young children (ages 5 & 8).  However, the provided beds were clearly insufficient. We requested a second bed, only to be informed of an additional charge. The manager arrived in our room with a credit card machine, an unprofessional approach compared to a proper front desk transaction.  Furthermore, we received no receipt for this unexpected charge.

The most concerning issue was the excessive wait time.  Despite waiting 3 hours for the second bed to be set up, no one arrived.  After leaving for dinner, we returned at 10 pm only to be told by the same manager that another fee was required, as the previous charge was for the first additional bed, not the second.  An entire hour was wasted arguing and clarifying this misunderstanding.

The overall experience was marred by a lack of clear communication from both staff and management.  If a misunderstanding occurred during check-in, it should have been addressed promptly and professionally.  The service was frustratingly slow, with delays in fulfilling even basic requests for extra towels and pillows.

The combination of confusing and unclear communication as well as slow service resulted in a disappointing stay.",Family,2024-06-30

The room was Ok, but the staff were unaccommodating and seemed disinterested in serving guests. All the staff we encountered during our stay. The swimming pool was small and dirty, with bird droppings everywhere and a foul smell wafted over whenever the wind blew. It was quite unpleasant.

At breakfast the next day, the staff member at the Flame Restaurant, the arabic lady, charged my card double the price despite us informing her from the beginning that we would be using a voucher. She insisted it was not her mistake tho we never blamed her, her gesture was very disappointing.

The private pool was a highlight, offering us a serene and exclusive area to relax and enjoy quality time together. The villa's amenities were top-notch, with everything we needed to feel at home and more. 

What made our stay exceptional was the staff's attention to detail and their commitment to making my mom's birthday special. 

Additionally, the entire resort was immaculate, and the services provided were impeccable. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff especially to Mr. Afshan made us feel welcome and well cared for throughout our stay.

Thank you, Retaj Salwa, for creating such a wonderful and unforgettable experience for my mom's 69th birthday. We will cherish these memories forever and look forward to returning in the future.",Family,2024-07-31

Service was exemplary. This includes the in-room check-in process, concierge service, restaurant service and housekeeping. The turndown service was extremely thorough although they don‚Äôt provide candy.

938487010,12059033,729,5,2024-02-16T06:57:12Z,The most memorable staycation,"Four Seasons Hotel (FSH) is a 5-star Forbes Travel Guide award winning hotel. I visited during February 2024, the weekend prior to Valentine‚Äôs Day for a staycation. My experience has been top tier with their level of customer service. It started from the moment I arrived in the Four Seasons at the front entrance until I checked out. 

I booked the romance package which included: early check in 12pm and late check out 4pm, 20% off spa services, 20% off for meals at two restaurants: Sin Toho and Dai Forni, sparkling juice, flowers, and a cake. During my check-in I inquired about my spa appointment to confirm, and the lady stated she would get someone to call me when I arrived in my room. I was so impressed that when I arrived in the room my suitcase was delivered shortly after within 1 minute and spa called me immediately to confirm my appt. 

When I walked in my room it was as expected for the romance package and included the sparkling juice, card, cake, roses in the tub, table in the room, and balloons on the bed. I absolutely loved the tub in the bathroom as this area was very spacious. It included a separate area for the toilet and shower for privacy. 

Next, I went to check out the facilities in the hotel: gym, indoor pool, outdoor pool, and spa. Going into the area was adequate water for guests along with fresh juice and snacks. I was greeted properly as soon as I arrived in this area. Employees were standing at the entrance and guided me to the gym and indoor pool. The gym is fully equipped with weights, cardio machines, weight machines, cycling room for classes and so much more. I was very impressed. 

The indoor pool is beautiful, and it wasn‚Äôt crowded. There are plenty of seating for all guests and they have a jacuzzi. Next to all of the seating in the indoor pool area they offer a button for you to get in contact with the employees if you need assistance. There are plenty of towels, water, and juice in this area for guests. 

Next, I went to the outdoor pool. This area was also not crowded. The jacuzzi is located inside of a kabana, which is epic. The view from the pool area is beautiful overlooking the city. I was assisted by Mery Jo (MJ). She setup my seat and gave me a cooler with water. She was very professional and assisted me in every way to ensure I was comfortable. The welcome to FSH fruit platter was a surprise and just shows how they value their customers at this hotel. 

I went to tour the spa as it offers facilities to all guests including steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, showers, lockers, and the relaxing room while you stay at FSH. In addition, there are other services offered at an extra cost. I was really impressed by the service of Lerian. She was very accommodating and explained the spa facilities to me. I‚Äôve never had a shower that offered so many options including tropical rain, island storm, arctic mist, and body sprays. The relaxing room has snacks, tea, waters, newspaper, books, headphones and a blanket to relax afterwards. 

I visited the Italian restaurant Dai Forni and sat outdoors with an amazing view. The waitress named Champa helped me with their menu. She was very professional and patient with me during my time at the restaurant. They gave me a welcome drink, mini bruschetta, bread, and I ordered pasta with shaved black truffle. The food came out fast and it was fresh.

I ate dinner at Sin Toho and sat outside again for the beautiful night view overlooking the city. My waiter was Faina and he explained the drink menu to help me to decide what drink paired best with my meal. I ordered wagyu beef ribs which is prepared at my table once it is cooked. It was so fresh and hot. I ordered the golden phoenix, and I was impressed at the taste. 

The breakfast was at the restaurant called Elements. It is an international breakfast buffet. They have everything you can think of to accommodate everyone. I was really impressed with the selections especially the variety of honey.  I suggest trying the truffle honey. Also, the two croissants: rose and my roll pistachio. Amod was very attentive to my needs while I was in Elements. 

I had the purifying ritual package at the spa. This includes 135 min spa services with 15 min steam, 60 min scrub with mask and 60 min dry massage. Yvonne was my therapist and listened to my needs that I needed focus for my massage. She explained everything that was going to get done. I feel so refreshed and rested after the spa. Also, Fatma the receptionist was very welcoming each time I came to the spa. 

I checked out and went to the cigar lounge near the outdoor pool. They offer a wide variety of Cuban cigars ranging from 10kwd to 45kwd. I ordered the wagyu slider and got a cigar to go for a gift. Moises explained each cigar and selection that I can purchase. It was a quiet area for you to lounge while either smoking a cigar or eating light food options. 

Lastly, my favorite of FSH is Al Soor Lounge. This is my favorite area because of the ENTIRE staff. They are well trained and ensure each customer is attended to in a timely manner. I am always greeted with my team and each staff is very polite to us. Thank to Karen, Ferurza, Helen, Lily, and Isabel who I interacted that day. Not only is the customer service on par, but the d√©cor is too. This time it was decorated with valentine‚Äôs day decorations. They had new desserts on display and the center piece of the room offered so many sweets for customers to select from as gifts or to indulge in at that moment. I had the golden rose and chicken Cesar salad. They offer a light snack your meal including olives, almonds, and crackers. I also got some of their freshly made bread. 

I highly recommend FSH if you seek a memorable and relaxing with high level of hospitality while in Kuwait. You will not be disappointed and there is a reason I continue to come back. If I missed a staff's name I interacted with while at FSH that wasn't my intention. The entire staff at FSH goes above and beyond. You deserve your five-star Forbes award and more!",Solo travel,2024-02-29

Don't get confused as I did when arriving (and likely many others...they were certainly use to explaining), but the Sheraton Four Points is located about 200' away and this Sheraton facility shares the property with Saint Regis hotel. Google took me to the other Sheraton and it was simpler navigating to use Saint Regis as my destination. The Club Lounge is useful but extremely limited. Surprisingly, they hotel will only issue money with a receipt. So, if you need money to purchase something (to get a receipt), you must use the ATM.

It was large, the bed was extremely comfortable, the floor was on (6) was nice and quiet and the food and beverage in the fridge was all of good quality and quantity.

Threatened to call the police on us! we stayed 7 days and during those days we had to ask the reception 5 times for house keeping, we received our breakfast twice  and the other days nothing! even after calling them. We ordered coffee received capuccinos! I don't understand why such hotel asking for a price of 70KD to 115 KD a night would employ such incompetent people, rude and ignorant.

- the furniture style was pleasant albeit a little dated, and the sofa was rather comfortable;

- staff wore gloves and mask, and the breakfast tables were set according to social distancing; 

Weaknesses:
- the lighting in the room was poor, many lights but all  dim, not fit for reading;
- the breakfast buffet had abundant choice, but the food was bland (the ‚Äúfoul‚Äú had no seasoning, the white beans were only partially cooked) and there was no coffee options other than instant coffee;

The receptionist apologised was very pleasant but told us we were at the wrong hotel and that the Courtyard was around the corner. At that moment Abdul (a manager I think) heard our predicament and enquired if we had a car, when we said we had been dropped by taxi. He then escorted us both across an adjoining corridor to the Courtyard on the 2nd floor past meeting rooms, spa, swimming pool and gym explaining how we could access all the other facilities. He was really very helpful and delivered us to the Reception where Bas ah took over and completed a very efficient and cheerful check-in, telling us all meal timings and services available within the hotel.
Just meeting these two made a great first impression.
The evening buffet I personally thought was again very good value compared to other equally smart hotels around Saudi.
There was a good selection of Western, Middle Eastern and Asian foods to try and savour. Breakfast again offered a very good selection in a buffet style.
The room itself was very clean and tidy good decor, although too dimly lit for me. The bed and choice of pillows gave me a good night's sleep which staying away is always difficult ultimately. Good quality towels and well stocked bathroom finished off a very good stay. I will definitely stay here again when I am in Jazan next. ",Business,2018-04-30

3. Minor issue (no big deal) but worth

953979589,224430,579,1,2024-06-06T10:30:33Z,Bed Bugs,"I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction and concern regarding the abhorrent handling of a bed bug incident during my recent stay at your hotel. The lack of proper protocol, follow-up, and resolution has left me utterly appalled and deeply disappointed in the level of service provided.

The incident occurred on Wednesday, June 5, when I reported a bed bug sighting at approximately 8:30 AM. Pictures were taken and shown to the front office manager. I was assured that the matter would be promptly addressed, and I would be informed if relocation to another room was necessary. However, no follow-up communication was provided.

Upon returning to the hotel around 11:30 PM, I inquired at the front desk about the status of the situation, only to be informed that I could indeed move to another room. Shockingly, there was no confirmation of the bed bug infestation, and the manager on duty was unable to provide any information as no notes were left regarding my complaint.

To my horror, I woke up on Thursday with bites, further confirming the presence of bed bugs. I promptly took photographs of the bites as evidence. Upon raising the issue again with the front desk, the manager acknowledged awareness of the situation but offered no satisfactory answer or resolution. I was merely told that I could speak with you, the general manager, the following day (Friday).

This egregious mishandling of a serious matter is wholly unacceptable. It is alarming that no manager present was capable of adequately addressing this situation, and it appears that no established protocol was followed. As a guest, I expect a certain standard of cleanliness and professionalism, both of which were egregiously lacking during my stay.

In light of this distressing experience, I demand immediate compensation for the inconvenience and distress caused. Furthermore, I insist on reimbursement for any extermination fees incurred at my residence due to the bed bug infestation. Additionally, I expect to be provided with a credit for a future stay at a hotel of my choosing, as recompense for the utterly unsatisfactory experience I endured at your establishment.

I trust that you will take swift and decisive action to rectify this situation and restore my faith in your hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction. Failure to do so will compel me to escalate this matter further and pursue alternative avenues for resolution.

I eagerly await your prompt response and resolution to this matter.",Business,2024-06-30

It is not at all clear to me why the hotel deserves an award.  Waiters don't want to look at you if you haven't shown money before, except one who work in the mornings . The only people who deserve to appear are people who work on maintenance, because everything is impeccably clean. The entertainment team on the beach is so annoying that there is no privacy at all. For every 5 minutes they come to say hello and ask some stupid question. We paid extra for rooms with a view of the sea and got a room with a view of the masts and more convincing how it is what we paid. Don‚Äôt wake in the morning because air conditions don‚Äôt work. I must also emphasize the failure in the ala carte restaurant sheherzade... do not go by chance!!! the most expensive dinner with alleged ballet dancers who look like children from a school performance for the third grade of elementary school.",Family,2024-07-31

If someone didn't leave their hotel, they shouldn't be talking nonsense. We walked around Hammamet by ourselves and went on a trip to the Sahara. Tunisians are wonderful people. Very intelligent, they know languages better than we do. They are very helpful and work very hard. Everyone cares about the client's comfort. Everyone. But from the beginning. When we arrived at the hotel and our room was being prepared, we already got our wristbands and could go straight to lunch. Big plus. The waiters took care of us immediately. As Poles, we are not used to such politeness. At first, it was a bit embarrassing that someone was so nice. But they are truly wonderful. From the very beginning, they ensure that no one lacks anything. Great respect for every employee of this hotel. The food is delicious. A huge variety. The rooms are clean, cleaned flawlessly. The beach is very close, also cleaned constantly. There are always free loungers with umbrellas on the beach for free. The same goes for drinks on the beach. It's worth supporting the hard work of these people with tips. I've never seen such hard-working and smiling people. The hotel is clean. The country is wonderful. For me, one downside ‚Äì Tunisia is drowning in trash. But the hotel itself, around it, and the hotel beach are VERY clean. Thank you very much for the wonderful stay.",Couples,2024-07-31

Hotel itself is ok although the rooms are pretty tired.
Room safe is free to use.
Plenty of hot water.

Staff are generally very friendly however it is the norm to tip staff.
Reception are polite however the male members of staff would not deal with my female partner when she made a complaint. They constantly belittled her and would only talk to me!

Music around the main pool made this a no go area for anyone who did not want a thumping bass echoing in their ears. The smaller, quieter pool did escape the noise and was chilled out.
The life guard did also move towels/belongings on subbed if they were left empty for over an hour.

I was surprised by the number of restaurant staff who tried to ‚Äúcharm‚Äù younger females. I twice had to intervene when kitchen staff were persistently asking a lone female if she was single and ‚Äúinterested in him‚Äù. This felt strange to me and I felt sorry for the guest.",Couples,2024-07-31

Cons buffet food is repetitive and by day 2 you wished you never went all inclusive, half the food is not either in English or labeled, I spoken to the TUi rep as I have a nut allergies I might aswel spoken to an alien.

Evening entertainment, where do I start with this. 5 nights being here I've still yet to see a show being put on worst I've ever seen in a hotel.

Make sure you stock up on food and drinks after lunch there is not much else going for you other then the basic snack bar Which doesn't have much to offer. 

Considering it's meant to be 5 star where is the ice cream for the kids or adults.

Kids there isn't much here for kids at all, one dead little water slide, when they say they have mini golf it's not, it's piece of grass and a net to hit the balls at, football pitch is crying out for some grass.

I could literally go on and on about how poor this hotel is, plus it's out in the sticks and nothing around for miles, o forgot to mention how rubbish the  little supermarket they have, sell like two different chocolate bars and some basic crisp no drinks at all.

In the room the fridge doesn't even provide you with a bottle of water or nothing.

Hotel is lovely, staff are friendly and helpful and food was very good, only slight down side is they cook two pizzas at a time and when there‚Äôs a que of ten people waiting for pizza, it all goes before you get any then your waiting for another two to be cooked. Saying that it was worth the wait! 

You also get two restaurant options to use as well as the main buffet restaurant. One‚Äôs the Moroccan restaurant on site which is five courses and lasts a few hours, the other is gousto‚Äôs Italian restaurant which is a two minute walk from the reception outside the hotel. We went here twice, food was delicious however you pay for your own drinks which I didn‚Äôt think was an issue, however the drinks prices are like London at 60 dihrams for a Coke  or 70 dihrams for a small bottle of beer!

The hotel is a riad which is a courtyard garden so expect there to be a walk to the hotel room and back as it is deattached from the hotel itself

The buffet isnt great, bottled water is warm there as it is not kept in refrigerators so bear that in mind when you want a cold drink. The food isnt special very limitrd with queues and the staff are not attentive apart from 1 or 2 there.¬†

The pool beds get taken up really early by people placing towels taking them up.

The snack bar is small and not great. The drinks are the same very basic and not great. Staff cannot be bothered, such as a wasp goes in they dont give you a new drink they scoop it out. Disgusting!

The excursion hut is very usual and prices are reasonable. We booked the hot air balloon, horse and cart, city palace tour and ourika valley so defintly recommend them. Abdul who works there is excellent üëåüèΩ definetly recommend

The entertainment is okay not mind blowing. Staff got a little attitude and a little moody

The housekeeping arent great they dont leave enough towels and move thing's around which they shouldnt touch at all. Mini fridge isnt filled therefore cant be a 5*.¬†

The front desk arent very helpful when you ringthem for anything expect them to take days to get ba k to you or they have forgotten. Called for an iron like 5 times!! Quite bad service

Spa isnt 5* they do not understand english and can be quite amateur with basic etiquette

Overall i would rate this hotel 3* it needs reviewing with its food and staff and amenties. If i came back i would try a different place as i am sure there are nicer ones. But at the same time enjoyed my stay with my 3 yr old.

Hope this helps all

Overall we have had a amazing time the staff are so helpful and friendly especially lovely lady in the restaurant who always looked after us I believe her name  was Santana but I might have spelt it wrong ,
Ahmed in the bar really looked after us kept the gin and tonic‚Äôs flowing and loved speaking everything football with my husband  ,also Mustafa at the pool bar who again provided amazing service with always a smile .
The Tui entertainment team were great and really chatty and friendly 
The food was amazing could not fault anything with the food
The hotel and grounds are spotless and well maintained
The hotel manager was visible throughout our stay .
The only negative with this hotel is the lack of sun-beds around the main pool unfortunately if your not up before 8am you will struggle to get a bed , also they have  7 daybeds that take up a lot of space around the pool area which are chargeable never have I been to a all inclusive resort in Europe or the  Caribbean that you can hire a daybed around the pool I think it‚Äôs a shame that the hotel  seems to be trying to make extra money knowingly that some people do not have the choice  but to purchase a daybed due to lack of sun-beds .In the 14 days I have been there I have only witnessed 2 occasions where the staff removed people towels  from sun-beds because they were not on them other than the sun-beds everything else has been fantastic.
Marrakesh itself wow bustling and chaotic take care when crossing the roads we visited the YSL museum and to be be perfectly honest walked around it in 10 minutes wasn‚Äôt worth the cost
We went up to the skybar which is attached to the hotel but not part of it so you have to pay for your drinks and food this was amazing and worth a visiting

962279003,6621142,550,2,2024-07-29T16:40:28Z,Awful end to a great holiday,"Genuinely gutted to have to leave this place a bad review but there‚Äôs no way round it. You will struggle to find a better location for a hotel in Marrakesh. The food was amazing for an all inclusive, the staff were friendly and the entertainment team put in a lot of work to keep everyone engaged in activities offering a range of activities.
However, the trip was unfortunately spoilt due to unforeseen circumstances.
Assuming that our room was secure, I stupidly left my gold chain (which was previously my dad‚Äôs and he gave it to me) by the side of my bed. After our room was cleaned, my chain was no longer there. We thoroughly searched the room at least 3 times and the chain was nowhere to be seen and I know I didn‚Äôt take it out. When alerting members of staff, they assured us they would investigate. However, the next morning they were no further on and preferred to take the side of their members of staff and encouraged us to go via the police. This meant that on the last day of holiday, instead of relaxing round the pool, I was accompanied by 4 police detectives who didn‚Äôt speak much English, treating my room as a crime scene. After this, me and my dad were taken to the police station where I was for 2 hours feeling very uncomfortable. At no point did I think that the Tui workers thought that my chain had been stolen but were happier to think that a teenager had ‚Äúmisplaced‚Äù it. Whilst I admire the hotels efforts to protect their own staff, this situation, in my opinion, was severely mishandled and we were made to feel like an inconvenience. Interestingly, upon reading trip advisor reviews, this hasn‚Äôt been the first incidence of theft at the hotel and appears that the police have  been involved before. In the response from the hotel, the reviewer was given the same scripted response that staff are searched when they leave the premises which was quite clearly not true. The hotel, after our experience, should be reviewed as a 1 star after spending my last day in a police station/guiding police detectives around my room, however, as previously mentioned, all of the Waiters, bar staff and entertainment went above and beyond to ensure our trip was enjoyable and for 9/10 of the time the stay was incredibly pleasant.",Family,2024-07-31
962282419,6621142,549,5,2024-07-29T17:06:33Z,Amazing 11 days spent..,"First time in Marrakesh, couldn't of picked a better hotel. Spent 11 days at the Medina Gardens with my girlfriend. Late arrival (9pm) but still managed to catch dinner. Easy check in process with bags waiting upstairs. Overall, for what is on offer at this hotel you can't really fault it. App booking system for all activities and entertainment offerings which is great and easy to use. 

Food was incredible, breakfast was very repetitive but is the case at majority of hotels but definitely opt for the freshly made stuff in front of you, its worth the wait in the morning. Lunch was far better in the snack bar from our experience but dinner overall was superb most evenings. Cullinarium was amazing with a pre booked main course and a choice of starter and dessert on the night. 1 visit per 7 days is always harsh but that's standard really. 

fortunate (or unfortunate) however much you love the sun to catch the hottest week of the year once we arrived, reached 45 on our 4th day which was ridiculously hot, very dry heat in Morocco so doesn't feel as harsh as like 38 with humidity but does get to you eventually. 

Location of hotel is amazing, we did notice we were one of the only couples that ventured outside quite a lot during the day and evening but there is plenty to do around the Medina, just be clued up with internet on your phone to know where you're going. Visited the souks twice, through the outskirts and back ways rather than through the main square. Be careful, as plenty of people there will take advantage of tourists and at night the square can be quite intimidating if you don't like a big crowd of people. We noticed very few tourists while there so its something to definitely bear in mind. 

We did 2 excursions, the Ouzoud waterfall experience and the Dinner in the desert with the camel riding. Value for money in these experiences were INSANE. Dinner in the desert by far one of the coolest things I've ever done and for 25 English pounds, no brainer. If you get the opportunity, book something and do it you won't regret it. 

Staff were incredible throughout, they work long shifts with majority working double shifts. Mohamed was really cool and got to know us well, all really friendly people who work incredible hours to ensure guests have a great time. 

Sunbed availability... limited in the morning as you had some getting up at like 5am putting towels on the sunbed (that could never be me) but early afternoon usually you'd get a space round the quiet pool. Plenty of space in the surrounding gardens but is quite a journey to either pool which can be annoying. 

My only real gripe with the hotel which surprised me was just the lack of attention to detail in the room, we had it cleaned everyday yet towels were forgotten a few times and the soap/shower gel etc were never topped up. We had to ring reception quite a few times to have them bring clean towels up which look was annoying but by no means ruins the experience this hotel gave us.

The penthouses are so beautiful with two bedrooms, a fully functional kitchen, two dining areas, an upstairs living room and plunge pool. We were spoilt in terms of space. The decor is lovely and has a real coastal feel. There are three pools to choose from all connected by longer smaller 'pools' which are shallow hence great for kids to splash about in.

I had booked a superior double room, which I was only expecting to be a bit bigger than a normal double. In the hotel across the road ""Shades"" we got put in a twin room, not what I had paid for. I asked for s room change to a double and was told they were fully booked aswell, but was assured I would get a double the next night at 2C hotel. Looking at the prices for the room they were similar, so although I wasn't impressed, the room wasn't too bad. 
On day 2 we packed up our stuff, which was a bit inconvenient as we had a trip booked that day and dropped our bags off at 2C as we couldn't check in until 2pm. I explained we wouldn't be back till about 9pm to check in. On getting back from the trip and checking in we got handed the keys and yet again they had given us a big standard twin room. Not impressed at all this time so I went back to reception asking for a room change. Again they told me they were fully booked so I asked for my money back as I had paid for a superior double. The receptionist got in a bit of a flap and some guy then came over to sort the problem out, telling me there was nowhere to move me to. Then they put me in someone else's room that hadn't checked in yet. after earwigging it turned out they were booked in the previous night and hadn't turned up (so why did I get moved to a different hotel the previous night). Once we got in the room it certainly wasn't superior but at least it had a double bed. 
 I would not recommend this hotel, the shower was cold, I had to stand on a box to turn the A/C on and the bed was tucked into a hole so you couldn't walk round it.

TV works, Wifi is strong on every floor and hot water and a strong water pressure, fridge and safe also provided. Next door is a convenience store if you need beers drinks or snacks. 

Those who complain about the beds, that's how the beds in Thailand are made so don't whine. And if you can't carry a suitcase up 4 storeys, then maybe you should stay home and not go on a vacation at all ! Just kidding ,  Nico I'm sure will be happy to help you with your cases.

The things that are nice at Mecca Camp is that they have a pool and bath house but showers were not always operable and had to be repaired often. They offer free WIFI but you cannot get any sort of connection. We even purchased a booster but still no service. This place is not a full hook up as they do not have septic or dumping station. They would go around the camp ground twice a week and manually pump you out and if you needed an extra dump you had to pay for it. So for larger families its not a good idea. A few times we had the water back you our bathtub waiting for next dump day and it was stinky and gross to have to sleep in close quarters with. They are pet friendly as I have 2 dogs I brought along. I always cleaned up after my dogs but other campers did not. they provided waste buckets and poop bags in hopes campers would clean up after their animals. I think a kind approach would have went a long way instead of assuming people would do it. The things that bothered me most about this camp is that the rules change without any notification. They should be notified via email, text, phone call, hand out, or a plain old conversation. they do not rent was raised without propper 30 day notice and no refunds if you leave early from your stay.",NONE,2022-03-31

The hosts provided towels and a coffee pot with coffee packets! The best parts was the heater and electric blanket for the queen size bed since two of the nights we were there was down into the mid 30's at night and we stayed nice and warm. The tent also had bunk beds for kids and a small fridge to keep things cold. The showers and bathrooms were super clean and the shower was nice and hot. Everyone staying at the camp were great and waved as they went by.  There are only a couple of negative things to take note of. The first is the campground Wi-Fi is extremely slow and wouldn't have been an issue for us except that our cell phones carrier didn't serve the Tellico Plains area and our daughter was fixing to give birth in a few days and we had a serious lack of communication with her. The other issue is that there  is a very limited number of places to eat in town. Thats not really an issue if you bring food with you and cook over the grill.

I had not realised just how busy the hotels were going to be during this week, because of the conference and other events. Virtually all the 5-star and 4-star hotels in the city were sold out for my travel dates. The only rooms available were some presidential suites at ridiculous prices, far off hotels, or some apartments (which had received bad reviews). So I decided to stay at this hotel (at 3 times the usual room tariff) as this was one of the last hotels that still had a couple of rooms available. The hotel, as one would expect from a 3-star hotel, was quite basic. No separate shampoo in the bathroom, a soap dispenser each for the sink and the shower.. the slippers tore after wearing them for 2 hours, the room
had a view of large air conditioning units nearby. The gym was literally 2-3 machines with no weights, and near the staff area of the hotel. The front desk staff and housekeeping, however, were quite efficient, and the room was acceptable. The location is also good. It‚Äôs next to Riyadh bank and 5 minutes walk from Kingdom Tower and walkable/short-drive from some good restaurants. Paying 5-star prices for a 3-star experience was always going to be disappointing. But I can‚Äôt fault the hotel for that.

This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at and will DEFINITELY be returning. The value for money is incredible because of all the extra luxurious amenities provided. The complimentary cocktail hour and afternoon tea are sublime. The cocktail hour was one of our favourites because the atmosphere created is just beautiful. It takes place in the courtyard under the softly lit palm trees, with excellent live musicians creating a magical atmosphere. The complimentary mini bar was a huge plus! As was the complimentary shuttle services to the mall and souk, amongst other destinations. The staff at the Shangri-La were very polite, welcoming and made us feel so special. A huge thank you to Mirco and Prakash who went the extra mile for us by building a rapport with each one of us. Every detail was paid attention to and we felt we were looked after to the highest standard. Nothing beats the level of professionalism, luxury or comfort that this resort and staff can provide for you. Everyone from the waiters, pool boys and managers shared the same attitude towards guests which was very humbling to experience. Al-Husn exudes luxury and tranquillity, the d√©cor and design of the resort is breathtaking. The view from any area in the resort is stunning. We loved that housekeeping staff came by in the evening to provide any additional items we needed, this was very convenient! 

The infinity pool was a real favourite of ours, the view makes you feel very relaxed and peaceful. Another thing which was brilliant was the cooler box provided by the staff, and the facial mist! These small details made us feel very appreciated and special. The choice of restaurants is good, however we felt that the prices were slightly high.

We visited as a couple, first holiday without children for 25 years and the memories will for ever stay in our hearts.

We are return visitors to Oman, (fourth time)  and it draws us back again and again due to its beauty, and warm welcome . In fact we are returning again to Al Husn in a few months time.

Al Husn‚Äôs staff are on another level to which we have experienced elsewhere. Whilst the service in all departments was exceptional, every member genuinely wants you to have the best time. They all work incredibly hard and their dedication to their work was humbling.

On arrival after an over night flight from the UK we were treated to the best, most attentive  check in we have ever had by Mustafah and his reception team. Rooms had every convenience you could desire, even down to flip flops for the beach. The bed was divine.

If you appreciate architectural detail you will enjoy the hotel which has a true Arabian flavour. We loved enjoying Arabic coffee and dates every day in reception, the sumptuous breakfast and afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks and canapes. Both the Indian restaurant and Sultanah were beautiful. I have written separate reviews for them.  Sadly the Indian will be closed for our forthcoming visit. 

We truly loved the serenity of this resort, it was calm and quiet due to low season and that suited us very well.

The beach is not to be missed and the infinity pool is an unforgettable experience. 

The extended resort over at Al Bandar and Al Waha extend to even more leisure pursuits with the beach, pool and lazy river. Sadly the only negative on our holiday was the reckless behaviour by water sport staff on the beach near Al Bandar.  I know they are not part of the hotel staff, but their behaviour was dangerous and we witnessed them being aggressive to a life guard when he tried to intervene. We felt nervous swimming on that beach. 
Due to the rocks in the water at the centre of the beach, swimming is restricted to areas away from this. These prime swimming spots, and snorkelling areas are taken at both ends of the beach by water sports. Much safer swimming and snorkelling is to be had at Al Husn private beach. 

Housekeeping were incredible as were all staff around the hotel. Special mention to by the pool at Al Husn who was one of those people who you meet in life who you know has a good heart. Thank you Said  for all the lifts in the buggy car to the beach and the laughs along the way. The guys on the beach who attended to our every need. As I said every member of staff is exceptional.

960030547,302117,433,3,2024-07-18T05:59:14Z,Book somewhere else if you are looking for something special!,"We are travelling as a family of three. We spent a lot of time researching and made our selection based on the fact the hotel advertised to being kid friendly.

We are five days into our 11 nights and have gone tona different hotel to stay for a couple of nights to get some selection and quality of food, facilities and service.

We are staying at Al Wada and are seriously underwhelmed with every aspect of the resort. It advertises as a five star resort but is far far far from this. 

We were looking forward to a selection of restaurants, basically everything is closed except a VASTLY over priced buffet.  We were given a sheet with the list of closures and were hopeful that might go to the itlaina one night that it was advertised as open, alas whwn called to book it was closed.  

The rooms and general decor of entire hotel are ver very dated and lack any ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor. 

Pool bar staff look constantly pissed off about having to work. 

Restaurant staff are very kind, totally disorganised, but pleasant.  The dining room in the buffet restaurant has the feel of a school dinner hall.  At ¬£100 for two for a buffet WITHOUT ANY DRINKS, would except something pretty good‚Ä¶.repetiive average is what you get.

Drinks are wildly over priced and all pretfy crap tbh. ¬£10 for a tiny glass of wine that i am sure costs less than a fiver a bottle.  Alcohol free beer is given in a can with either a plastic mug or just a can at ¬£10.

In he evening there is only one small place to sit outside, where they have two BROKEN outdoor a/c blowing hot air, there are no fans.  Service at this area is poor as the staff are used in the dining room.

The kids zone is tired and all the toys are either ripped, torn, faded or broken. Again very low quality.

We are really disappointed with the whole experience and it is sadly lacking in all aspects. Great marketing on their website, absolutely shambolic execution in product.

This hotel needs regraded to 3-star at best.",Family,2024-07-31
960325671,302117,432,2,2024-07-20T10:56:36Z,Not a 5 star hotel,"We stayed at the Shangri-La in July 2024 with our two kids (4 years and 8 months). 

We were supposed to stay 6 nights at this hotel but shorted it to 3 nights.

We were at the Al Waha wing. This is not a 5 star hotel. We stayed in many hotels worldwide, as well in few Shangri-la hotels but this one was the worst experience of that hotel chain. 

Upon check-in, we were informed that the main pool area is closed due to some work going on. This is unacceptable as we were not informed at the time of the booking neither afterward through an e-mail. 

Room: We had an executive room with sea view. Rooms are very dated though housekeeper do their best and room was always clean. 

Breakfast: food is ok but we had to make coffee ourselves! Never did that in a hotel and this was quite surprising for us. 

Restaurants: 
We only tried the Samba restaurant and had to wait more than 45 min to get our food which was nothing particular but disappointing. We also ate once at Sirf cafe but again the food is not what you look for at a 5*. Though, staff try to give their best. 
We haven‚Äôt tried other restaurants as most of them were closed.. 

Pool
With both kids we were few times in the pool. 
The lazy river is nice but enough for a one time experience. 
There is no (fooddrinks) service at the pool. This is kind of things you are looking for during the holidays in order to relax. The sundbeds and umbrella are old and not in a good condition. 

Beach: nice view from the room for sure, but not attractive when you are closed to it. 

To summarize, staff is nice but this experience was disappointing. The hotel is disastrous and the management needs to rethink about the whole concept and experience they would like to offer. Very poor quality. My advice is:  don‚Äôt go there, there are many other hotels in muscat. 

We were very happy to leave the hotel for another one.",Family,2024-07-31

959464248,505500,428,1,2024-07-14T09:06:56Z,Horrible experience,"This is by no definition a 5 star hotel. Almost everything is original, decades old bathrooms, furniture. Extremely outdated. If you are from the west I highly recommend you pass on this hotel. We were singled out and made to feel extremely uncomfortable by the staff during check-in. We know it was a discriminatory act because we decided to leave and the next hotel  (roughly one block away) did not follow the same protocol. We also researched the KSA laws which do not promote the type of discrimination we experienced here. We had visited Medina with the hopes of experiencing the kind nature the city is known for across the globe - we were discriminated and humiliated by this hotel staff instead. We were paying $500 a night for a single room, not only did they rob us with such an outstanding rate for an old and disgusting room, they had the audacity to question whether we were Muslims and single us out based on our U.S. passports. 

We left the hotel as soon as we could book an alternate location. We notified the hotel manager we were leaving early based on the experience with their staff. There was no reimbursement or cancellation of our reservation. We lost $500 by leaving early but it was worth getting out of there. The Hilton was more than happy to accommodate us - and in accordance with KSA laws did not hold up check in to first determine whether they felt like we were actual Muslims or not.  

The bed mattresses need to be replaced, they are extremely warn. Tiles in the bathroom are original which means you get to shower with tile and grout that have years of grime residue. Not to mention the shower is a suitable size for a child. It is extremely small making it nearly impossible to shower without touching the disgusting, original, tile. The walls are PAPER thin. You can hear your neighbor snoring. The air circulation is poor. The elevators are small and frequently slow due to minimal capacity.",Family,2024-06-30

We had a couple of nights in the mountains with our children (5 and 10) staying in one of the tree houses at Douar Samra. 

The accommodation was perfectly thought through and tasteful - we loved waking up overlooking the mountains to the sound of birdsong.

Douar Samra is the perfect place to relax, the terraces are so tranquil and you can watch mountain life go by.  The kids were entertained with board games and visiting the donkey and ducks + trecking to the waterfall.  

Eating in the communal dining room was lovely, illuminated by candle light at night.  It meant we got to enjoy the company of other guests and the food was delicious.

From the start to the end of our stay everything was up to the highest standards. 

I stayed with my wife and my one year old daughter for 6 days, and the staff, especially front of house and breakfast staff went the extra mile with my daughter every day, as a newish parent this is appreciated highly. From treating my daughter with mandarin toys to keeping her entertained and just a smile and hello in the morning kept her on top of the world. 

The hotel is located in the Mishreb downtown district, now this may not be a beach front property but honestly  I believe this is an ideal location;
Lusail city - 20 mins driving 
Souq Waqif - 5 minutes walking 
Museum of Islamic art - 5 minutes driving 
Kata - 15 minutes driving 
The pearl - 17 minutes driving 
Villaggio mall - 15 minutes driving 

The hotel has ample amenities; a very clean and well equipped roof top pool, with attentive staff. Breakfast was fresh, delicious, clean and the staff accommodated all of our requests down to the T, after 2 days most things were provided for our daughter without even having to ask. They also have a cafe, we serves afternoon tea, we did not try this but seemed very popular, there‚Äôs also an additional restaurant. Finally there‚Äôs an ice cream located to the rear of the hotel with absolutely Devine sorbets! The house keeping staff were excellent with a very high quality of cleaning with no corner missed, regular treats in our room and ample supplies of excellent toiletries, for some reason your shower gel is one of the best! 

There are also two masjids in very close walking proximity 

The rooms are very spacious and well equipped, we opted for 2 double beds and these were actually very large double beds, I‚Äôd say more towards king. The bathroom is excellent with all you could need plus more! A very large walk in shower, separate bathtub, double sink and separate toilet. 

Valet staff were super helpful and underground parking is provided, the valet staff were always on point to help with our pushchair and any shopping.

My only negatives:
1) the curtains in the room need some adjusting, because they are automated they don‚Äôt align perfectly and can let in light unfortunately. 
2) we had a power cut on two separate instances, but this was the area and not the hotel, however, management  rectified this fairly quickly. 

I have been very bad with names this time around, but I‚Äôd like to say thank you to the front of house staff, the chef and staff at breakfast in mosaic, the pool staff and housekeeping who all took extra special care of us as a family especially our daughter, thank you kindly especially from the princess Sofia and I hope you know who this review is from!

This hotel caters mostly for business people and we found our room to have one slight inconvenience - it had a table/desk instead of a dressing table, meaning my wife had to plug in the hair drier by the mini bar in order to use the glazed back as a mirror.  Apart from that, we found the room to be very comfortable and quite large at 51 sq. meters.  The air conditioning (extremely important in Qatar), was efficient and easy to control.

The hotel isn‚Äôt the biggest or most modern in the area but is perfectly adequate. The rooms were well appointed and very clean with a nice balcony, comfy bed, functioning aircon and large shower. By far the greatest aspect of this hotel is its staff, always cheerful and eager to please they cannot do enough for you from the buggy drivers and reception staff to restaurant and bar staff. The standout is Suma in the main restaurant, a lovely lady that checked on us each meal to ensure we were satisfied. Other staff who deserve a mention in the restaurant and main bar are Sandun, Mohammad, Nirmal, and Manowor who all went out of there way to ensure we were well served and content, they collectively made our holiday special. Food is very good with plenty of choice, peak dining times are best avoided as it can become crowded, but the restaurant is open for lengthy periods so going a little later or earlier to lunch/dinner will make the difference. All inclusive drinks are a little limited but this is normal for AI and I cannot complain for the price we paid for our stay. There is building work ongoing either side of the hotel but the reception staff made us aware of this on check in and allocated us a room so as we didn‚Äôt even notice the building work. The buggy to a from your rooms with luggage is a nice and appreciated touch. Don‚Äôt miss the happy hour is the ice cold air conditioned sports bar! Proper drinks such as Stella and Thatchers gold in cold glasses and during happy hour(s) UK pub prices! I believe there is an option to upgrade to a package that includes drinks and food in the sports bar for a very reasonable price,  but we didn‚Äôt learn of this until near the end of our stay or we would have done so. Entertainment is the usual AI affair, some good, some not so good, but we made friends in the hotel and made our own entertainment in their company.

Nestled in the serene and scenic landscape of Ras Al Khaimah, this resort is truly a haven of tranquility and opulence.

A special mention must go to Mr. Siva Bhaskar Reddy, the Director of Operations, whose vital efforts and role truly shine through in the hotel. Siva's commitment to guest satisfaction is not just evident; it is palpable from the very first interaction. Siva has an exceptional talent for making guests feel valued and heard. His approach is both personable and professional, creating a perfect balance that puts you at ease while also ensuring your needs are meticulously met. He took the time to personally welcome us and provided insightful suggestions about the myriad of amenities the resort has to offer. His deep knowledge of the property and genuine enthusiasm for his role were truly impressive.

What sets Mr. Siva apart is his proactive approach to guest relations. He doesn‚Äôt just wait for feedback; he actively seeks it, ensuring that every guest's experience is nothing short of flawless. During our stay, we observed him engaging with guests of all ages and backgrounds, addressing their needs with a level of care and attention that is rare to find. Whether it was a simple question about the best local attractions or a more complex request regarding personalized services, Mr. Siva handled each interaction with grace and efficiency. His leadership is reflected in the seamless operation of the resort‚Äôs various facets, inspiring his team to deliver consistently outstanding service.

One of the standout features of our visit was the exceptional customer service provided by Mr. Ahmed Souliman. Ahmed went above and beyond to ensure that we felt welcomed and taken care of. His warm demeanor and infectious smile created a wonderful atmosphere in this beautiful hotel. He even went out of his way to fulfill our requests and provide us with quality services. His dedication is truly remarkable and admirable, making our stay feel incredibly special.

The fantastic service extended to our dining experiences as well. Dining at Mekong Restaurant was an absolute pleasure, largely thanks to the impeccable service provided by Uraiwan and Mr. Irman. Their attention to detail, coupled with their genuine hospitality, made every meal a delightful experience. The fusion of flavors and the exquisite presentation of dishes left us craving for more.

Equally impressive was the service at Sea Breeze Anantara Restaurant, where Yassine, the manager, ensured that our dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. His attentiveness and keen eye for detail made each visit to Sea Breeze a memorable one. Yassine's warm hospitality and commitment to excellence were evident in every interaction, creating a dining ambiance that perfectly complemented the exquisite cuisine.

In conclusion, Anantara Mina Al Arab Ras Al Khaimah Resort is an absolute gem. With its breathtaking surroundings, luxurious amenities, and exceptional staff, it offers an unforgettable experience that leaves you longing to return. Whether it‚Äôs the meticulous care from Mr. Siva Bhaskar Reddy, the warm hospitality from Ahmed Souliman, the superb dining service from Uraiwan and Mr. Irman, or the fantastic service from Yassine at Sea Breeze, every element works harmoniously to create a truly magical stay.

We called the hotel a week in advance to make sure all arrangements were set in place for our wedding anniversary and birthday. We were a group of 14 with 5 rooms booked. Our room were booked from the 12th July. We arrived on the 13th July to find our rooms were not ready. At 5am we were told to wait and go have breakfast at the buffet. At the buffet we were refused breakfast as we did not have our rooms allocated and were told to pay though we were all inclusive. 

Once we got our rooms we found non of our pre arranged request were carried out and were told even though it's stated on the system records the hotel forgot.

Moving forwards the rooms were shocking to say the least. Bathrooms were disgusting please see photos.

After many complaints the issue was not resolved and we gave up just trying to make good memories from a bad experience and not to waste any more time trying to resolve this. 

However the issues continued from bad service at buffet to raw food and nothing to put it right after many complaints to management.  Please see pictures.

Food for kids is non existence and it's first come first served. Simple things like fries were not available for kids in the main buffet. 

Kids were not allowed in the main pool though we seen kids in the main pool when we went in our kids were told to get out. 

Iron plug was broken major hazard but after complaints it still wasn't changed, see pictures.

European cup finals was a mess. No seats available and only showing the football on a small screen were there was no room to stand in a bar. Health and safety non existence. Even the workers were shocked that management did not have this sorted prior to the game.

We emailed about 10 days in advance and got copies of the a la carte restaurants and booked time slots. We had read one or two reviews about being unable to book as all slots were gone so didn't want this to happen. We also booked the free airport transfer.

Had lovely food and well looked after in Mezze ( served by Ratna, Ranjet,Pingki and Debanjan)  and Bay tree for lunch and breakfast. 

Had some issues with the room air con, but spoke to reception and it was promptly dealt with. ",Couples,2024-07-31

I recently visited Rixos Hotel and, unfortunately, had a very disappointing experience. Despite my excitement to enjoy a meal at this establishment, I was met with unwelcoming behavior from the security staff.

Upon arrival, the security guard stopped me and questioned my reason for visiting the hotel. Although I clearly stated that I wanted to dine at the SOL Beach Bar, I was further interrogated about my residence status and whether I had a meeting at the hotel. This level of scrutiny was unwarranted and uncomfortable.

As someone who has lived in Dubai for 13 years and visited numerous hotels and restaurants without any issues, I was shocked by this treatment. The experience left me feeling unfairly judged based on my appearance, which is unacceptable. It's disheartening to think that such a reputable establishment would allow guests to be treated in this manner.

I urge the management at Rixos Hotel Ras Al Khaimah (Al Mairid)  to address this behavior and ensure that all guests are treated with respect and hospitality. This incident has left a negative impression, and I hope that steps are taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

Unfortunately, due to this experience, I will be choosing to visit other venues",Solo travel,2024-07-31

Property is fantastic. Clean, spacious, modern,.
Rooms - spotless, pillows soft and special, bathrooms have speakers can be connected over Bluetooth.
Pools - superb.
Most importantly, the people... excellent. Always a step ahead to assist you. Eager to serve to the best of their abilities.

Cons -
Breakfast Menu, Food quality and Variety and Taste.
- Choice of items, not good.
- Almost same food everyday, and changed items repeats on alternate days.
- Even Hummus tastes different.... not good, not usual.
- Yogurt - in one bowl and by the end of the day, its all watery.... should be separate small bowls or cups.
In short, it was not good.
Being one of the best properties around, I suggest to check the menu and quality of food served in Intercontinental Fujairah. (Please note - cost of breakfast is in the similar range)",Family,2024-07-31

On the way ,we saw a lot of Gazelle roaming freely and falcons flying.
On reaching the campsite,we were greeted by Adil and were taken to our Dome.
Right in front of the Domes is a water body,in which we can do kayaking.They have a Majlis and also a TV and game room.
The restaurant serves Arabic and some international cuisine  for ala carte dinner and Arabic breakfast.
They have a coffee machine in the restaurant,were we can have as much as coffee as we want.
Since it's on an isolated island,don't expect the best of everything.But whatever is provided is good enough as long as there are guests who are not so choosy.
Overall a very relaxed and a peaceful stay .

The room itself is so minimal. The lights flicker. When the outdoor light is switched on, the fuse blows. The furniture has burn marks and looks about 30 years old. The beds are uncomfortable and hard.

The air conditioning in the bedroom is appalling. And so noisy yet barely works. We had an awful nights sleep.

We were told BBQ facilities available yet no charcoal. So we had to go to Carrefour to buy everything ourself. And no outdoor lighting. No cutlery in the room. None available to borrow.

Beautiful ocean and nature. That‚Äôs the thing I loved the most :) so many palms, flowers, bushes, trees etc. The air quality there is amazing. Air was really clean and fresh.
I want to thank the staff for the two free boat trips we had. You get to go on those if you stay at the hotel for 5+ nights. The first one we had was crab hunting, and the second was a trip to the Mangrove islands, to see flamingos. It was super interesting and fun, although crab hunting was a bit scary because of the darkness haha. After hunting the restaurant team cooked crabs for us :) that was really sweet and the crabs were amazing.
The only negative thing about the stay was very strong audibility in rooms. I had to sleep in earplugs every night due to how loud it was; music from the beach bar, people walking, people talking to each other very loudly (a lot of staff did that btw‚Ä¶), all of that we could hear perfectly.

954172856,672053,224,5,2024-06-07T22:27:19Z,Fifty Shades of Food @ Flamingo,"Flamingo Beach Resort @Umm Al Quawin UAE
June 07, 2024
 Set aside any pretensions of snobbishness, and arouse the true beach experience enthusiast within you and you will find that tucked away in Umm Al Quwain is a quaint but delightful experience. Close to the mangroves and literally at the end of this long stree, which towards the end shows you old UAE, you come upon the Flamingo Beach Resort. Arriving here took one back to the late 1980's when the East coast of UAE had a few privately run beach resorts. From Umm al Quwain to the end of the Fujairah coastline they were priceless destinations. This was way before hotel chains or booking.com got onto this scene. 

Flamingo Beach resort reminded us of those days, with a very pure formula: Excellent service, a beach, and shaded pergolas and staff that attend to you all the time. There is a pool too, and a kids pool and showers and toilets all handy. Its not pricey and you pay a fraction of the price you would to put your towel on a sun bed in hotel on the Palm. True this does not have the ring of five star luxury you expect in many hotels, but in fairness it delivers the basic things, shade, sun, a clean comfortable sun bed and service 5 star hotels have lost. 

If one had any doubts of why one has decided to come out for a beach experience an hour and quarter from Dubai the coup de grace of Flamingo is its food. Brought out to the beach the food is absolutely exceptional. There isn't a place in the UAE, so far, which can compete with the Grilled Prawns that you get at the Flamingo. The grilled meat platter, the salads, the drinks all are exceptional. On the second visit met up, by accident, with the chef, who is from Syria and loved his humility and approach and his philosophy of clean fresh food as it would be cooked at your home. 

When you visit a luxury branded hotel you always struggle to pin point where the experience philosophy comes from and you realise it really is a corporate approach designed and put into a policy in a far away headquarters of a management company. Here at Flamingo if you come back a few times you will meet Mr. Ali Salameh, the General Manager, who drives the family run experience onto a slightly bigger platform and does it with passion and unassuming personal involvement. All the staff know and respect him and you discover soon all the staff know you. From Noman at the beach bar, to Suffian who brings the towels and cleans the sun beds, to Santosh also at the beach bar there was not a single staff who did not smile and were happy to serve you. 

One may say the beach is small and there is sea grass under the water (this is normal near a mangrove and actually very good) and its not as private as in some luxury hotels but its what defines this place. The good experiences make you not notice things you may miss from elsewhere. In our estimation, the Flamingo is a gem to be held, and thanks to our friend who introduced us to this place.

Pros

Excellent service.
Exceptional food.
Staff very caring and attentive.
Clean and well kept, especially the garden leading to the beach and the beach.
Homeliness which branded hotels cannot create.
Cons.

The final approach road being built.
Could do with more parking. 
Add signage for guiding visitors. 
Overall Experience.

Its on our list for regular visits and have already done a few trips there. Its the sort of gem you want to keep to yourself so not too many people flock there. Exceptional and inviting.",Family,2024-05-31

The hotel staff surprised us with a kind birthday cake gesture, which made our stay even more special. The property boasts two nice pools and a small beach area, perfect for relaxation. The food options are fantastic, including the Bavaria Garden Restaurant for delicious German cuisine, Barako Grill for authentic Filipino dishes, and an excellent Indian restaurant. The in-room dining options are also varied and tasty, ensuring you have plenty of choices without leaving the comfort of your room.

960845998,1230268,176,2,2024-07-23T09:39:41Z,Say hello to the bad service üòê,"Good day to all who read this review!üôã
We choose this hotel more than once and are happy to be regular guests. But, unfortunately, our last vacation was overshadowed by the poor quality of service.
Let's start with positive emotions.
‚úÖA fairly budget price and a good set of services provided by the hotel.
‚úÖYour free transfer to the beach (but there are questions about it)
‚úÖYou will not stay hungry. A good selection of dishes at the buffet.
‚úÖWonderful desserts. And there is a large selection of them.
‚úÖExcellent beach staff and the only department that does its job efficiently and responsibly. The guys are always smiling, watching the safety of the guests. No one on the beach is left without attention. They already know me personally. And we are always glad to see me back at the hotel. This shows their customer orientation. I wish them patience in their difficult work.
‚úÖLarge and spacious rooms

Now, I want to pay great attention to all my DISADVANTAGES listed below. I have devoted all my conscious youth to the hotel business and I know how high-quality and good service should be provided. And the base of this service is employees who meet guests in hotels. They are the face of the hotel. And I don't really want to go back to our last vacation with Ramada.
There was a high workload and absolutely every department of the hotel worked disgustingly. I'll go through each one separately.
Upon arrival, we were met by the reception. Everything was fine at first. The administrator, Mohamed, as regular guests, took into account all the wishes of the room. He showed it to us and raised our category. He was smiling and sociable. Next, I addressed other problems at the reception, which will relate to the housekeeping department. I often contacted the administrator John. The best front desk employee. He always smiled and helped in everything. In general, the reception did not leave any negative emotions. There were minor misunderstandings and shortcomings. But they didn't leave much emotional coloring, unlike the others.
Next, we were met by employees of the houseeping department. When we entered the room for the first time, Houseman was still finishing his check-in cleaning. We asked the employee to bring us adapters and a clothes dryer later. To which, in response, it was said that he would do it if he was given a tip. To the question of whether this is normal. He smiled. We tipped your employee and did not offend him. But the quality of cleaning during the week of stay was poor. Especially the balcony! Birds constantly flew to our balcony, where things were drying, and pooped on them. The reception and the housekeeping department advised us to dry our things in the room. To be a logical person, they dry very slowly in the room. But after my expensive things were ruined twice by a bird, there was no other way out. Later it turned out that he was. And I do not understand why this was not done immediately, but after the conflict. The workers put a grate on the balcony after 4 days of our dissatisfaction. The balcony was poorly cleaned. He was always covered in bird poor. It was only in recent days, after the conflict, that it was removed. It was dusty everywhere. The quality of cleaning is 3 out of 5 points. The reaction to the guests' appeal is 0 out of 5 points. I called the department at 10 p.m. I asked someone from the houseeping staff to come to my room. After 20 minutes, no one came and I called again, already angry. Because why do I have to repeat my request many times? To which there was an answer. That the employee did not understand what was wanted from him, so he did not come. And they also laughed. It's not very funny. 
I can rate the houseeping department by 2 points out of 5 points.

Department of Food and Beverages. My most ""favorite"" department. And how they loved me. Big greetings to them. A very strange and unpleasant department. 
Once again, there was a high occupancy of the hotel. And the small restaurant was often full. I had to stand in line and wait for a table. Good. There is no question about it. One day, I was in a bad mood due to feeling unwell. Cashier Renie decided to kill all my love for the Ramada Black Hotel.
She saw that I was in a bad mood. And she asked me three times for my room number. At the end, I asked her how many more times do I have to repeat this? After all, you wrote down my room number in your notebook for the first time. She rolled her eyes. And the manager came at that time and asked me for the room number again. I was angry. Renie told her boss in English that she needed to find an empty table faster. Otherwise, there will be drama. I told Renie that I understood everything she was saying and she should be careful with her words. She explained to me that I had misunderstood her. I didn't say anything. And from the queue, a man completely unfamiliar to me asked Renie in English, ""what's the problem?"" he was clearly interested in why he was not allowed into the restaurant, and not what problems I had. But the restaurant employee, a Filipino girl Reni, decided to give an assessment of my character and my problems to the guest. And she said, ""Everything is fine, it's just that the drama queen can't wait even 2 minutes for an empty table."" Of course, it made me angry. Your employee tells another guest in front of me how inadequate I am. The manager knew about it. But I didn't do anything. Absolutely nothing. He started apologizing and gave me an empty table. I told him I didn't need a free table. I need an apology from this girl and that her boss should explain to her what she is wrong about. This did not happen. When I left the restaurant, I asked Renie personally to apologize. Renie apologized disgustingly and sarcastically and said she was right. The question of adequate words of sorry was raised throughout the rest. The management of the Department of drinks and food apparently do not know English or have some problems understanding what a guest needs. Absolutely everyone apologized, but not the cashier Renie, who is to blame for this. I don't need apologies from people who didn't insult me. I don't need tables empty, I don't need fruit plates. You could just say, ""I'm sorry, I was wrong."" She doesn't know that the guest is always right. This is the law of the hotel business and hospitality. So no one understood me and this situation was extremely unpleasant for me. I told her manager that I wanted to work in his department. Because you can say and do anything at work and I won't get anything for it. Did the manager say ""thank you!""????????? What??
Next is the Department of bus drivers. Only one driver is a polite employee who always smiles at everyone. The rest are terrible. In May and June, they did not arrive on time! And every time, there was not enough space on the bus from the beach. Wait for the next one for about 10 minutes. Every minute of this heat is hard. Make a canopy in the parking lot, if possible. People get sick while they wait for the bus. 

Also, absolutely all employees make such hand - ü´∏  gestures in front of the guests. That's rude! And disrespectful. They have such a forbidding sign. Because tourists do not know English and they decided to do it this way. 

There is a man walking around the hotel who offers to buy tours from him. Namely, the Parus company. He is rude and does not accept the word ""uninteresting"". In response, he begins to be rude and say, what are you interested in in this life? Stalking on the street.

I don't know. My impression of the holiday was ruined.  I always left good reviews and they were all 5 points. Because I really liked everything. But this time was most likely the last. I want to relax, not listen from the hotel staff, which is not in my nature. Then leave the hotel business and work in the office. This is a guest and he is moody. And you work for his benefit and for his whims.

P.S. Thanks to the employee Otabek for his help in solving all the issues that are written in the reviewü§ù",Couples,2024-05-31

The worst of it was the building work, very very loud bore hole drilling machine starts work at around 9pm, It went on all night and was letting dangerous, gas and petrol fumes all over the resort, I could not go onto the balcony let alone sleep. 

The service was pathetic, paint would dry faster then you'd receive service in this hotel.

There have been changes between visits, but the outstanding Customer service, quality of food and drinks have absolutely been maintained.

When we arrived at DXB, our luggage was still at LHR. The outstanding front of house team, in particular the wonderful Rushi, managed to arrange the delivery of our luggage at the earliest opportunity. 

We dined mostly in BablBar for lunch and the team work tirelessly. The outstanding chef Emakor Suchang prepared the most delicious delights and tailored them to our tastes. Yasmina was so friendly and efficient in attending to everything and Joseph is an outstanding mixologist who prepares the best margareeta.

In the evening, we dined at Mejhana, and were looked after superbly by Swajay and the chef Pankag.
We did occasionally visit the buffet restaurant and Darun made me the most exquisite Dosa.

Not to forget the wonderful staff at the pool, especially Wifred, who ensured that we were always in the shade

The gentlemen who do the beds and umbrellas they are always smiling running in the heat moving umbrellas and helping find a sun bed, polite, sincere and very helpful.
Amanda and her team at the Indian, the food was not to my taste as I don‚Äôt like very spicy food what I did eat was of a very high quality .

The staff really made our stay extra special, your hotel will be one of our best memories so thank you and your team for these wonderful memories.
Frazier made us laugh daily and my husband still loves it he remembered his name and shook his hand when he saw him.
Others who made our stay special are :-
Malith this gentleman and his colleague (whom I regret can not remember his name but he wore a silver wedding band ) work tirelessly to try and help people with beds and umbrellas, always a smile on their faces,  especially Malith is unique and a valuable part of your team.
Colley always a smile or wave as we walked pass the coffee shop, remembering how I took my coffee.

From the moment we left Manchester Airport on an Emirates Airbus it was pure luxury all the way, even being in economy class was luxury. When we landed in Dubai airport we had a private transfer included to the Ajman Saray. From the moment we checked in at the hotel with Servitlaana until we left we were treated like royalty, the hotel is a 5 star luxury and you can see why. Our sea view room was very spacious and the beds and pillows were so soft and comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. The swimming pools were really nice and cool in the heat as the sea was really warm and felt like having a warm bath. We were served drinks and cocktails all day poolside and even in the pool if you wished, the service was unbelievable and a special mention to Methu, Paul and all the other waiters for looking after us. The Bab al Bahr lunchtime restaurant served amazing food by excellent staff and always greeted you with a smile, thank you Helen and all the staff. The Safi buffet restaurant was fantastic but we preferred the Mejhana restaurant which served Indian and Arabic food which was absolutely gorgeous and a special mention to Hakim (our waiter) and the chefs Pankag, Suniel for going above and beyond to please their customers, the food they served was out of this world.

Spectrum restaurant is wonderful and had a great range of world foods. We especially loved the curries. In addition to the red and white wine on the menu, you can also order rose wine here too. Joan, Yoon and Yi were very friendly and professional and always remembered our names and drinks orders.
The swim up pool bar is a great feature and Rashyak was brilliant and always had the drinks ready. We had no problem getting sun beds- there are plenty at the pool and also lots on the beach. At this time of year the sea is hot but it is wonderful to be able to watch the sunset from it.
Housekeeping was immaculate- a massive thank you to Sanka for some beautiful touches and cleaning so thoroughly for us every day. What a hero.

The food is very good ( Quality,  quantity and presentation). But my favorite thing about this trip is the surprising design of the place,  it was literally a tent that is insulated from the elements with peak of comfort and all you have to do is just to open the door and engage with nature, open the sustainable slide door and look at the sea and collect seashells and have fun, come back to your tent , take a dip in your swimming pool then cool down inside your (home tent).",Family,2024-07-31

The lobby was great and a 5 star indeed, offers welcome drink while you are waiting to be assisted in the lobby.  Our room was very spacious and was upgraded with a balcony.  With complete amenity from toiletries, mini bar etc.  The only thing that was not in the room is a coffee machine.  We wish theres one but it was an instant coffee.  Nevertheless it didnt affect our experience.  I love the bed and pillows, it was very comfortable.  The AC despite of the hot weather it was cold and never had any problem.  Their HK team was superb and very keen in cleaning and doing room make up, unfortunately i didnt get their names.  For their facilities, the gym is open 24 hours and all equiptments were great.  The pool was huge and caters different kind of age and height as they have for toddlers to adults.  What i love most is the beach, never disappoint me.  Clean, enough sun beds and friendly lifeguards.  Unfortunately we didnt had the time to dine in since the location of the hotel is nearby border of ajman and sharja and nearby there were different options of restaurants.

962140873,304479,95,4,2024-07-29T01:41:25Z,Last minute family holiday,"Just heading home from a lovely holiday. Honest review is the hotel says it has renovated but truth be told the hotel feels behind the new modern hotels. When we arrived we were given the option of a sea view with two single beds or on 2nd floor with city view with king bed. As we are a couple we wanted a shared bed. Unfortunately when we got to our room you could not call it any view. Only positive we could dry our wet swim wear. Disappointing from a Sheraton. Loads of cigarette butts also outside. Not tidy at all. Other negative was no bath tub. My partner enjoys a bath. Previously been in Dubai we never had any of this issues.
The room staff made a great job everyday. Always leaving enough water. Had to ask for soaps to be topped up one day but no other issues. 

We chose this hotel as I got the impression it was geared towards families. Definitely not the case. Kids club was dreadful. Fussball table and a couple of children toys. Open to anybody which I feel is not safe especially if kids go in alone as there was a lot of electrical equipment. 
Pools were nice but definitely need more kid facilities if you want to deem it kid friendly. 

We were half board and upon first night we thought we really screwed up. Our little boy is not the greatest eater and to say there was nothing for him was not an exaggeration. We spoke to staff and mentioned this and honestly they could not have done more for us. I mean they were a credit to the hotel. Hem and his team were outstanding. Sheraton are very lucky to have him and staff. They went above and beyond for us every breakfast and dinner. Every night there was something to eat for us being the adults. Definitely not the scale of certain Dubai hotels though buffet wise. You got by. 
Even put on French fries, nuggets or pizza and ice cream. Shouldn‚Äôt need to ask for this items for kids. 

Staff throughout the hotel were brilliant. From reception to front door staff. All very friendly. 
I understand the review seems negative but only certain parts. For a couple it would be fine.

Would I stay again. Possibly not. I would look to go for a more modern hotel with loads of kid facilities. Even possibly more towards Yas Island area.",Family,2024-07-31

We encouraged our travelling companions to do the same and we both enjoyed our time there immensely. 
We had a half board package that gave us a sumptuous breakfast and an evening meal that had several theme nights but always the basics as well so plenty to chose from.
The hotel is quite large so it was a long walk from our room to the Cafe and pool facilities which was probably just as well considering the amount of food we enjoyed.
There is also a Library on site which has a range of books to borrow or buy along with a coffee bar and delicious pastries to rival the French ones. As well as The Cafe, there are two other restaurants and a beach Bar/Cafe servicing the well appointed sun lounges on the beach. Iced water is always on offer  to  keep you hydrated in the heat of the day.

Despite calling twice and sending two emails regarding a booking for a stay from 11th to 16th August, I received no response. I was promised a follow-up during my calls and requested a prompt reply in my emails, but heard nothing. This blatant disregard for customer inquiries shows a lack of respect and responsibility. As a potential guest, I expected better communication from a reputed hotel. This experience wasted my time and caused significant inconvenience as I tried to finalize my travel plans. Good communication is the cornerstone of hospitality, and Abu Dhabi Dusit Hotel has fallen severely short. I urge the hotel management to address this issue immediately and improve their customer service. Ignoring inquiries is bad business practice and disrespectful.

We stayed in a three bedroom Rabdan villa with its own pool. However, we made use of the main pool every day and had half board option so dined around the various hotel restaurants as well as using the poolside restaurant on most days. The villa was superb and had a large dining room, living room area, multiple bathrooms a kitchen and washing facilities if you needed them. However, the stand out for us was the quality of service. From the moment we arrived at the hotel when John as front of house welcomed us personally and ensured and checked in with us every day of our stay to make sure we were happy with our stay through to Venkey our villa attendant who gave us his WhatsApp details straight away and would give us lift around the facility, arrange transportation and dining reservations every day as well as checking to make sure that everything was perfect in the villa several times a day. The attendants around the pool area were superb making sure that there was sufficient towels, endless free water (which is essential in these exceptionally hot temperatures) and were constantly moving umbrellas to ensure you had UV screening to protect you from the worst of the temperatures and sun.

The pool and gym were excellent with the pool being chilled this time of year which whilst quite shocking when you first get in is really welcome as an escape from the heat and the gym was really well equipped and an impressive facility that we made a lot of use of.

We dined Giornotte for breakfast every day and most evenings but we also dined at Mijana, the Lebanese restaurant which offered us superb range of food on the half board option and the Forge, which is a nice steakhouse which again offered a broad selection of food as part of the half board dine around. You can go off menu if you choose to but there really is no need given the range of choices available under the half board option.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone be they a solo traveller, couples or indeed a family such as ours. But the real standout is the exceptional way in which the staff choose to treat you and really welcome you.",Family,2024-07-31

Service: service was great from the get go. Saurabh always kept out room in tip top shape and delighted the kids with animals made out of towels each day.

Praykta in particular made our dining experience in Li Jiang, where the food was exceptional, a real treat, going out of her way to look after us and make sure our whole family was satisfied. 

Food: no complaints here. We had a half-board package. The breakfast and dinner buffet offered up a variety of options at a good standard. Of the featured a la carte restaurants, as mentioned Li Jiang was the real standout, the Sushi in particular was superb.

Room: well presented and had a nice view, as mentioned previously it was well maintained. There were one or two niggles and imperfections, but nothing material enough to impact our experience.

Pool: relatively quiet given it's the low season and the heat was probably a bit much for most. If you go around this time of the year, I'd advise going an hour or so before sunset.",Family,2024-07-31

He does a lot of travel all over the world plus we have also had to live in a Hilton brand hotel for over 2 months as we were relocating from one state to another.   Hilton on Yas Island was not just an incredible place to stay it was an EXPERIENCE.

So let me elaborate on what I mean by this‚Ä¶.

For starters, the hotel is breathtaking, the layout, orchids all on the table in the center when you first walk in.  The staff greeting you at the door with a smile welcoming. The pool with cool water pumped in to keep it refreshing.  TIP: Use caution walking on the tile around the pool it is VERY slippery.  I fell wearing flipflops a couple of times.  I would suggest add a mat along the back side of the beach loungers for people to walk without slipping with wet.

The room, very spacious with comfortable bedding and the bathroom with a separate toilet and its own closet!! Makes it so you are not all on top of one another as you are navigating to get ready for the day or turn in for the evening.

The SPA

I went on a Tuesday which happens to be HALF OFF for LADIES... I requested for a magnesium massage which was the BEST massage I have ever had in my life by the wonderful massage therapist, Sasima.  I think at one point I passed out and woke up to forgetting where I was because how relaxed my session was. Also, the access you also get to enjoy before your session: Steam room, Sauna, jacuzzi, sound shower, and a relaxing area to wait for your session.

The Resort

Access to multiple of shops, restaurants, night life, infinity pool (adults only), Kids clubs, transportation to the theme parks, and much more‚Ä¶.

The Executive Lounge ‚Äì leaving the BEST FOR LAST, if you have been with me this far

I wanted to leave this part to recognize the AMAZING staff: Subhra, Lailah, Diana, Phyo, Parry, Franklin, and Yvonne.  These individuals were the ones that made our trip so memorable.  Over the time my husband has been there and to even the short time I was there with the kids.  Each morning, they had a special place set for our family and knew what we wanted for breakfast.  We were not only treated like a valuable customer but also a friend.  The selection of food is small because it is not met for daily meals but very delicious and great varieties for a nice snack. I joked about after I left that they start putting out more seafood because I let them know I was allergic, but they do their best to accommodate any needs we had to their ability which I did not have a lot.  Because of this group of individuals, I have recommended this hotel to everyone I have spoken to, friends, family, and coworkers.

962514540,3528575,56,1,2024-07-31T06:32:33Z,Bad Loyal customer treatment,"I was excited to book my second stay at Rosewood Abu Dhabi, having had a pleasant experience during my first visit. Unfortunately, my recent stay was marred by rude treatment from the front office team on two separate occasions.

The first incident occurred when I requested to change my room to a twin room, anticipating the arrival of an additional guest. The front office team made a simple request incredibly complicated, citing issues because my booking was made through a third party. Despite my frustration, I chose to remain quiet and accept the inconvenience.

The second incident was even more frustrating. Due to an urgent need to travel back to my city, I requested that my brother stay for the remaining days and handle the checkout on my behalf. Again, the same lady from the front office complicated the process, insisting that I contact booking.com to make the arrangements. This level of obstruction and lack of helpfulness is unacceptable, especially from a five-star hotel.

While the hotel itself is beautiful, clean, and classy, my experience with the staff has left a sour taste. I will not be booking at Rosewood Abu Dhabi again and can no longer recommend it to my friends as I did after my first stay. I strongly advise the hotel management to educate their staff on how to treat their valuable guests with respect and professionalism. Please do not respond with a generic reply. Other hotels have handled similar situations in a much friendlier manner, as I have experienced before.",Business,2024-07-31

962589276,2154485,52,4,2024-07-31T15:25:23Z,Revisiting - can it live up to a memory?,"Second visit for me to the Towers, although previously it was pre COVID when it was still a Jumeirah property. Nice touch was that some of the reception staff did seem to remember me from 2018!

Pretty much everything was as I remember, which means a cracking room, great food and attentive front of house and housekeeping. Ray's bar was great for watching the Euros too. I was on floor 40 and the room was excellent,and I highly recommend a trip up to the observation lounge on the 80th floor. Fantastic views!

I would say that given the extremely low occupancy at the hotel while I was there earlier this month the pool area was seriously understaffed and often getting the attention of a staff member for replacement ice or towels or ordering anything etc was a frustrating and extended process. Similarly the options for dinner were somewhat reduced, but to be fair that's to be commended given that it would reduce wasteage.

That aside, there were a couple of other hints that costs have been cut since pandemic or Conrad takeover (not sure which) such as no free water with dinner (not sparkling, just boggo water) and no newspapers any more to your room. The in room coffee machine worked fine so long as you didn't mind pressing / holding the button a lot to get a decent size mug üòÅ

Little things but they add up in my opinion.

All said and done I do recommend the Conrad Etihad Towers, it's a spectacular hotel design wise with very well trained staff and spotless, modern rooms - but for me it's lost a tiny bit of magic compared to the Jumeirah era.",Solo travel,2024-07-31
962614976,2154485,51,5,2024-07-31T19:18:06Z,There aren't enough superlatives!,"The staff seems to have given thought to every detail aimed at ensuring an unforgettable stay whilst leaving guests eager to return. From the very first interaction with Martin at the entrance welcoming us, to Jess efficiently checking us in and giving tips on things to do, to Patience simply assisting us with directions to the elevator. Throughout our stay every single member of staff had a genuine smile and were eager to assist with any request/query. Whether it was Flora and Himanshu observing my love for coffee and leaving extra coffee pods and sugar, proactively, in my room during turndown service or the assistance Narah provided in getting our bags to our rooms, we were consistently impressed. 
Meal times and the meals were equally exceptional. Prima Fancy who worked the diamond section was outstanding! She went above and beyond to provide exceptional service day after day. Liwza, Jude, and chef Surya also displayed a level of commitment to excellence which was refreshing to say the least. Mandip with whom we interacted on our last night at dinner in the Rosewater confirmed our desire to be repeat guests at this hotel. When we informed him of our early morning departure, he ensured that we had a grab-and-go bag with coffee, hot chocolate and fruits/pastries waiting for us at the front desk. 
Our failure to mention all the individuals we interacted with by name is by no means a slight but merely to keep my review concise. Kudos goes to the behind the scenes staff as well for a meticulously kept property. 
Great service has certainly been redefined for us!. We're eagerly anticipating a return.",Family,2024-07-31

We were offered our preferred beverage first when we sat at our table and that came out quickly enough. When th lock box was brought over, I have to admit, I was amazed. The presentation was imaginative and lovely.  The savory and sweet selections were all delicious and more than enough for two people to share.

If you like noise and mayhem you‚Äôll love it.  Definitely not a hotel with any class, style, or elegance and not for families.

We were charged for breakfast and lunch, even though on half-board, and had to complain to have this credited back on our card.

Location of the hotel is not the best, 20 mins from the airport it's on a developing island which in 10 years will look a lot different. 

If you like planes then this is a plane spotters paradise. This is not an exaggeration when I say planes fly over the hotel every 3-4 mins. This hotel is on the direct flight path to dubai airport for take off and landing. Did it spoil my time here, no, but some people may not like this. 

Short distance from the airport only 20 mins which some will favour, but in terms of visiting downtown Dubai and what is has to offer its at least a 30 min taxi ride (¬£15 each way) to the Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa and a 45 min taxi ride( ¬£25 each way) to the Dubai Marina. There are always plenty of taxis' and you can pay with your bank card. They are always on a meter and very clean and professional. 

This hotel only offers bottled water in your room and not around the pool areas so be prepared to drink water from a water dispenser at the pool bar. I would consider taking your own water bottle as the reusable plastic glasses are a bit dated and some people do not like this. As its very hot, you drink a lot of water. Beer was of the draught version which I like, but some people prefer the bottled varieties that you get in other hotels I've stayed at in Dubai. All other drinks were very good, Wine, cocktails etc.

The dining experience was limited to the indoor restaurant, This is a very big restaurant and we were told the only time the other restaurants options which were available at lunch is when the hotel had over 1200 guests! The a la carte restaurants in the evening were very good so this can help mix things up.

There were plenty of sunbeds so no issues in getting a bed however they do not have mattresses.

The entertainment team do a very good job and do not hassle you into taking part if you do not want to.

Great friendly service and staff were very attentive. The pool was a great relief from the heat and lounging in the afternoon was comfortable. Rooms were spacious and well taken care of, morning and night. We did not get to eat there but the Lobby Lounge is very comfortable, piano player too in the afternoon. Staff were top notch and we truly loved our stay here. Would recommend it to all. ",NONE,2024-07-31

962671010,656624,16,5,2024-08-01T07:04:39Z,Could not ask for anything more,"After previous visits to Dubai we wanted to stay away from the beach and marina this time but still either easy access to the Metro.

We were originally going to book Sofitel Obelisk but it didn‚Äôt have any balconies in the rooms so switched to Raffles.

Location
10 min taxi from Airport 
5 min walk to Metro
Direct access into Wafi Mall

Rooms
Big rooms with plenty of storage and plugs (all 3 pin) and a free to use safe.

Bathroom had separate shower and bathtub with two sinks. Water temperature was great and shower pressure good.

Good size balcony which overlooks road or pool. Either option is good.

Room came with minibar (we asked ours to be emptied so we could use it as a fridge), iron, ironing board and hairdryer. Iron was good, never used the hairdryer.

The electric curtains were a great idea as could be operated from the bedside. TV was only compatible with Android but they got us an Apple box for our iPhones so we could watch Netflix etc.

Water bottles supplied everyday.

WIFI
Free and pretty good around most of the hotel. Did get a bit weak in the room balcony though but not really an issue.

Food
Good size hotel has its own restaurants but we only visited the Azur one for breakfast.

Breakfast used to be buffet style but has now changed to a buffet area which a crepe/pancake area as well as an Indian station plus a menu to order directly from your table. The food quality was excellent every day.

We also opted for the Club Lounge access during our stay. This gave us afternoon tea and evening canopies everyday. Afternoon tea included drinks, sandwiches and scones whilst the evening canopies had a small buffet selection as well as drinks (including wines and spirits).

Cost wise if you use the lounge access for most of your stay it is worth it. But if you just use it occasionally probably not worth the extra charge.

Note: you will require trousers for the evening canopies session.

Pool
Medium sized pool with a decent amount of loungers and all very clean. We had plenty of space now but not sure how it would be in peak season. Also a pool bar available for drinks and food.

The water was a nice temperature too.

Gym
A decent size for a hotel gym and equipment was in good condition too. Great changing room facilities including a jacuzzi and towels provided.

Staff
Although there are many great hotels in Dubai it is the staff that make this one really special. 

Everyone we met greeted us with a smile and a friendly greeting. Always attentive, professional and extremely helpful. I really hope Raffles and is rewarding its team accordingly.

From first booking the communication from Vimansa (and Anissa) was prompt and professional.

Then we had the amazing club lounge team looking after us. Thanks to Angelique, Sharif, Ogu and the others for this.

The pool team were also fantastic as well as the breakfast team and the cleaning/room service dept (sorry can‚Äôt remember all your names).

Without all of you this hotel would not have the amazing reviews it does.

Shopping
The hotel has direct access to Wafi Mall which has a small range of shops including Matalan and Carrefour supermarket along with a small food court.

Overall
A fantastic hotel to relax in while close to the Metro for exploring. Not really much for young children to do though as it‚Äôs more an adult oriented hotel.",Couples,2024-07-31
962264736,656624,17,5,2024-07-29T15:06:36Z,Impeccable Restaurant,"We had a wonderful dining experience at Solo. The seafood pizza was perfectly crafted with fresh ingredients, offering a delightful mix of flavors. The pesto pasta stood out with its rich, aromatic sauce and perfectly cooked pasta. The bruschetta was a great starter, with its fresh tomatoes and fragrant basil on crispy bread. Our evening was made even more special by Anirudh's excellent service. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu, ensuring we had everything we needed. Overall, Solo is a must-visit for anyone seeking authentic Italian cuisine with top-notch service.",Couples,2024-07-31

Eze, Awasaf, Santosh, Ibrahim, Tessera and many others provide outstanding service and are always quick to help. The only suggestion I have is to offer the option of emailing receipts to guests for easy record-keeping in case the hard copy is misplaced.

962205137,20059330,23,5,2024-07-29T09:07:53Z,Best place to enjoy Dubai to the fullest!,"The hotel itself deserves a visit since it was designed by Zaha Hadid Architectural firm. The hall after the main entrance is a supreme delicatessen to the senses. Its location is a plus, close to Burj Khalifa and with breathtaking views to the skyscraper.
The comfy rooms have also a modern design, from the bed to the shower, all under the signature of Zaha Hadid group.
The cosy restaurant for breakfasts offers all kind of choices, enjoying the views to the spectacular lobby. Everything delicious, of course.
But, above all, I give the highest rating of the hotel to the staff. They really do everything you may need in other to make your stay unforgettable. I would like to thank to Claudia and Mar√≠a from the front desk and Jos√© Mar√≠a for the warm welcoming and for making our stay so special.",Couples,2024-07-31
